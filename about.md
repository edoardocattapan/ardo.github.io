Hi, I'm Edoardo Cattapan.

This blog is an experiment about me trying to think clearly and be wise, to independently enquire some open territory of ideas with my own intellect, to be a truth-seeker and a sense-maker at my own risk, for myself.

If you happen to like reading some of my essays, I hope you can find some value here and you will make something good out of it.

Edoardo
