Hi, I am Edoardo Cattapan.

In life I am trying out many different things, from competitive sailing to entrepreneurship, to investing, to a career as a business manager, but one constant way of thinking I have always been entertaining in my mind is to independently enquire some unexplored territory of ideas with my own intellect.

My intention with this blog is to share a few independent reasonings I have built upon some ideas that are already established.

Thank you for reading: I hope you will see some value here, and maybe make something out of it.

Edoardo
