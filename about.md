Hi, I'm [Edoardo Cattapan](https://edoardocattapan.com).

This blog is my account of seeing the world anew with my own mind.
I try to think independently and enquire some open territory of ideas with my own abstract thinking, from my own insights about life and reality.

If you like reading my essays, I hope you can find some value here and you will make something good out of it.

Edoardo
