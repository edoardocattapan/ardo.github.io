This is a page where I share some projects I am working on.

My first project is "Questions", an attempt to formulate a list of questions which respect 3 criteria:
  - the true and proven answer remains yet unknown to humankind
  - finding the true answer implies expanding human knowledge in a given area
  - the issue is important to humankind

Questions are very important. They originate all progress of knowledge and serve to make sense of information.
In an age where artificial intelligence is presumably getting more powerful to provide answers faster, cheaper and more accurately than we humans, our scope increasingly relies in asking better questions.
