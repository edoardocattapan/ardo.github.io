Hi, I am Edoardo Cattapan.

I like to try many different things in life and have done so, so far: from competitive international sailing to entrepreneurship, to investing, to a career as an investment analyst and a business manager. One constant way of thinking I always entertain in my mind is to try to think clearly and be wise about it: to independently enquire some open territory of ideas with my own intellect, to be a seeker at my own risk.

My intention with this blog is to share a few independent reasonings I have built upon some ideas that are already established.

Thank you for reading: I hope you can find some value here and will make something out of it.

Edoardo
