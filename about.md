Hi, I am Edoardo Cattapan.

I like to try many different things in life and have done so, so far: from competitive international sailing to entrepreneurship, to investing, to a career as an investment analyst and a business manager.
This blog is another experiment, about one constant way of thinking I frequently entertain in my mind: to try to think clearly and be wise, to independently enquire some open territory of ideas with my own intellect, to be a truth-seeker and a sense-maker at my own risk, for myself. A few times I find the time and patience to write everything down and publish it here, so if you happen to like reading these things, you're welcome.

My intention with this blog is to share a few independent reasonings I have built upon some ideas that are already established.

Thank you for reading: I hope you can find some value here and will make something out of it.

Edoardo
