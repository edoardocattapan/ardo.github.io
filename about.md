Hi, I'm [Edoardo Cattapan](https://edoardocattapan.com).

This blog is a series of essays to account for my independent intellectual enquiry: seeing the world anew with my own mind.
I try to think independently and enquire open territories of ideas through abstract thinking, starting from my insights about life and reality.

I openly share the content and don't track readers, so you are free to stay and copy.
If you like reading these essays, I hope you can find some value here and make something good out of it.

Edoardo
