This blog is a series of short essays to account for an independent intellectual inquiry over some open territories of ideas, starting from personal insights about life and reality, through abstract reasoning.

I apply no paywall, no copyright, no tracking in this website.
If you like and find some value in these essays, please make something good out of it.


“*A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on. Ideas have endurance without death.*” ― John F. Kennedy
