This is a page where I share projects I am working on, in the hope one person is inspired and acts.
My first project is an attempt to formulate a list of questions which respect 3 criteria:
  - the true and proven answer remains yet unknown to humankind
  - finding the true answer implies expanding human knowledge in a given area
  - the issue is important to humankind

Questions are very important. Questions are at the origin of thought, and serve to ultimately make sense of information.
In an age where artificial intelligence is presumably getting more powerful to provide answers faster, cheaper and more accurately than we humans, our scope increasingly relies in asking better questions.
