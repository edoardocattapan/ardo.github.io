Hi, I'm [Edoardo Cattapan](https://edoardocattapan.com).

This blog is an account of my attempts to think independently and enquire some open territory of ideas from my own insights, to reason clearly, seek truth and wisdom, to see the world anew with my own mind.

If you like reading my essays, I hope you can find some value here and you will make something good out of it.

Edoardo
