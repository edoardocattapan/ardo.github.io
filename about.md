Hi, I am Edoardo Cattapan.

I like to try doing different hard things in life, and some experiments so far went well: from competitive sailing to investing, to a career as an investment analyst and a startup manager, to entrepreneurship.

This blog is another experiment, about me trying to think clearly and be wise, to independently enquire some open territory of ideas with my own intellect, to be a truth-seeker and a sense-maker at my own risk, for myself.

If you happen to like reading this blog, I hope you can find some value here and you will make something out of it.

Edoardo
