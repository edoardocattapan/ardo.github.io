Hi, I'm [Edoardo Cattapan](https://edoardocattapan.com).

This blog is my experiment to attempt thinking clearly and being wise, to independently enquire some open territories of ideas with my own intellect, to reason through my insights and seek the truth by making sense of it all, for myself.
By reasoning independently I am building a new worldview.

If you like reading my essays, I hope you can find some value here and you will make something good out of it.

Edoardo
