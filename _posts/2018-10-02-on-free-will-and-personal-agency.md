Scientific literature in neuroscience and studies in human behavioral biology do not provide support for the idea that we have free will.

According to Wikipedia, free will is "the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded".

I do not think this is a strong definition, because an individual with the ability to choose between different courses of action is still necessarily inscribed in a given process of causal happenings – either deterministic or random –, of which this "ability to choose" is just a part.

In fact, with my attempts to think independently about this topic, I come to define free will as the hypothetical possibility for a subject to be able and be free to have chosen deliberately any option other than the one which the subject, at one point, chooses.
To me, free will makes sense as a retrospective concept: to assess whether there is any space for a free, subjective determination of reality between a process of happenings (deterministic and/or random) which are not caused by choices independently taken by the same subject.
In other words, whenever you are presented with a choice (e.g. grey or blue) and you choose one option, then you have free will when you could have chosen - in a free way - the other option.
And I would argue that, because of the very definition of retrospective concepts, with free will we are artificially re-interpreting the past by adding an arbitrary ability to interfere with the real conditions that made the choice possible in the first place.

Neuroscience found there is a time-lag between the firing of neurons originating a thought and us being conscious about having that thought: there could lie the window of possibility for a subjective  and independent authorship of reality to take place.
In other words, there is a time-lag occurring during which external information reaches our perceptions and then our conscious awareness.
This phenomenon is known as the "postdictive illusion of choice".
Because of this time-lag between our consciousness and external reality, our brain makes up for the delay by inferring an anticipation of information that has yet to reach awareness but has already been perceived subconsciously.
Of course the critical issue here is the “independent” adjective attributed to that subjective ability to choose.
In fact, no choice can be taken independently or without the influence of neurological chemistry, genetic factors, factors originated during fetal development of the individual, cultural and environmental factors, biological factors of the human species and the conditions of the Universe we live in.
Neither pure determinism, nor pure randomness, nor any combination of the two, allows for "free will" to make sense.

Free will is an illusion.

And it is a very stubborn one, because it is the rational premise at the foundation of subjective judgments of any sorts: choices like good versus bad, right versus wrong, true versus false, just versus unjust.
Free will makes room for the (apparently) legitimate ability to subjectively judge things.
It is therefore at the basis of hatred as well as praise.
It is at the basis of criminal justice and appreciation of things.

Nonetheless, it is due and important to acknowledge that annihilating free will does not decrease the legitimacy of personal willpower, or grit, or determination: these factors continue to be relevant as ever in playing a role in what happens.

Annihilating free will does not annihilate a sense of self-authorship, self-determination and personal agency.
It's true that I am not an independent, free agent; but this does not mean that I don't have agency over my life.
In fact, human agency is very prominent in living life.

**It is precisely your self-created sense of agency over deciding who you are, what you believe in and what you do that originates the direction of your life.**

In a world where people - rightfully - don't believe in free will, there is no basis for condemning criminals (as they are not directly imputable for any bad actions), nor for awarding prices or celebrating individual talents or collective achievements.
It would be a very different world than the one we live in right now, both culturally and actually. It would be a world where people just be themselves and live their lives, being more understanding of the reasons behind bad actions from bad people, and thus a more compassionate world.

So we finally come to be aware of the fact that we are not the actors in the movie of our lives: we really are closer to being like the spectators who watch the movie as it unfolds.
But we are not just sitting at the cinema: we are clearly inside the movie itself.
Also, we may just be the spectators and not at all the actors of our lives, but we are aware spectators: the kind of spectators who can watch the movie unfold and, at the same time, be very aware of the fact that we are just in the spectator seat and not at all in the driver’s seat – no matter how engaging reality is for the mind, nor how stubbornly the illusion of free will persists.

The annihilation of free will does not mean the annihilation of awareness.

As spectators of reality, we can be aware that we are being the spectators, at which point we become aware of the cinema environment we are in, which then indicates that what we are is really the space of possibility for anything of this sort to exist in the first place: the actors, the movie, the spectators, the cinema and the illusory reality where all of this could and does take place.

I am also convinced that destiny is a myth, in so we do have agency over the future.

In this sense, acknowledging other realizations (the self is a space of awareness and love-consciousness), we can suddenly come to the realization that this moment that you are reading these words and thinking and just being is the place where you exist.
This place is not located in your head, nor in your heart: it is not a physical place contained inside the physical world where your body is immersed.

This place is an awareness point, or better an awareness level or a "state" of consciousness, possibly configured as the space in which everything happens.
