To live in a state of flow is what is important from a perspective of psychological mechanics.
For a flow life to be meaningful, there needs to be the fulfillment towards a greater purpose: to help advance a good cause that is mutually believed in by the individual and his people.

This is so, because the individual dies but Life does not die with him.
So the contribution to Life (be it conscious or not, human or not, "civilized" or not) - the individual being a small part of it - is to be a good part of it.
"Good" meaning closer to evoking feelings of joy, peace, love, unity according to one's own personal judgement - and meaning "useful" according to society.
And to do so silently and humbly - knowing that entitlement and virtue-signaling to play finite games of social status are really misallocations of merit and attention.

The meaning of one's life is that it be lived with a meaning - be it given or self-generated.
Whatever topic that meaning might revolve around, all that is really essential is that **the conscious experience is pleasantly ordered** in a way that, at any moment and at any rate, non-controllable things are accepted and employed, while controllable information and resources are consciously chosen and allocated, to the achievement of one's chosen goals and mission of advancing a good cause.

The meaning of one's life is to feel joy and fulfillment in existing.
To live in a state of flow, removing blockers to achieving the flow state.
To have inner moral integrity, intellectual honesty, the ability to learn and be self-reliant, to forgive, let go, never fixate on anything specific, be open, build, experiment, to accept, appreciate, to change perspectives and assumptions, to create, to develop, to play.
To have fun in doing so.

*My personal example*

I love sailing, investing and learning.
I am talented at thinking abstractly and analytically and at focusing.
I enjoy expressing the virtues of honesty, courage and kindness. The last two forming the binomial compound of love: strength and warmth.
I would like other people to recognize my honesty, courage and kindness.
Honesty is being real and morally and intellectually coherent.
Love is courage (being curious, brave, inquisitive, intentional) and kindness (giving, respecting, helping).
I enjoy expressing these qualities in public speaking and writing, in bold actions like impactful entrepreneurial venturing, and in my way of being peaceful, serene and intentionally helping others.

My most joyous moments have been in winning sailing championships and in speaking publicly.
My visions are to win sailing world championships, to speak publicly in a world stage, to live with my family in a big modern home by the sea or lake, to have a billions-dollar networth.

My north-star is the flow state: pleasantly and effectively ordering my conscious experience.

I care for truth.
To seek it, to preserve it, to enjoy it.
This is why my most important values, coupled as of intellect and of action, are: curiosity and courage (to seek truth), honesty and resilience (to keep truth), humor and kindness (to enjoy truth).

In a perfect world I see everyone being honest and loving (having courage and being kind), saying things like "we agree this is true, so let's do it!". Truth and action.

I would fight my inner evils of falsehood and hate.
Falsehood includes drama, hypocrisy, superficiality, lies, white lies (of omission), fakeness.
Hate includes being too self-centered, rude, and feeling like a pessimistic, bored, passive victim.

*Therefore my life's purpose would be to speak and write publicly, win sailing championships and build bold entrepreneurial ventures to intentionally help others be more honest, have courage and be kind.*

**But trying to define one's own life purpose is like trying to find one's destiny: they are a-posteriori retrospective summatory perspectives on what one has been doing with the present moment all along.**

So, as it is lived, the purpose of life should be the purpose of the present moment: to make the most out of it, live in flow: with awareness, enjoyment, in a way that is useful to the fulfillment of some greater goal, serving the present things that we control with virtue, to develop yourself and add value to others, to do what you love and love what you do.

Now, frankly, this whole endeavor of finding the meaning of life, or to know how to go about creating it, really seems to be very difficult and possibly impossible.
Given the absence of a good-enough answer to "what is the meaning of life?", it only makes sense to keep asking the question in different and new ways in order to understand the issue better and increase the chance of finding a good-enough answer.
This means to be curious abouth the nature of the Universe, and therefore to aim at getting a better understanding of the Universe, to keep asking better questions about the Universe for as long as possible, for which it is a necessary condition to increase the scale and scope of consciousness (biological and digital) over time and space, which in turn would mean to maximize the likely lifespan of humanity, to increase the chances of a good future.
Here, the purpose of any curious individual is to be useful in enabling conscious human life to stay on the path of better understanding the nature of the Universe, the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is the Universe.
To eventually understand the nature of the Universe is the purpose of humanity as a whole.

This means to decrease the likelihood of humanity ever going extinct, at least during this endeavour, and to make sure curiosity and imagination thrive.
To exist and ask two questions: "*why?*" and "*what if?*"

If this is true, some practical implications for curiosity and imagination to thrive, are to make sure knowledge is accessible to as many people as possible, to see general education (arts, humanities and sciences), especially STEM subjects and especially the hard sciences and the scientific method, as a fundamentally good thing to be enabled and incentivized for current and future generations.
To appreciate the long-term perspective.
To understand that a conscious individual's life is only one very small and precious part of Life as a whole.



Moral values of today that can affect the next millennia:
- Cosmopolitanism: being a global citizen
- Longtermism: species-long (1M years) view, inter-generational equity for future generations (99% of all humans ever)
- Concern for non-human species: animal rights and welfare
- Consequentialism: moral choices are not to follow some rules, but to consider the 1st-2nd-nth order effects of our choices
- Liberalism: it is not granted that liberalism always trumps authoritarianism in practice

Causes to advance:
- liberal democracy (RDI)
- individual freedom & privacy
- animal rights & welfare
- open knowledge (Wikimedia Foundation)
- STEM education (Carnegie Science, Thiel Foundation, Musk Foundation)
- AI safety (OpenAI)
- Climate change
- Mental health
- Global health & pandemic prevention
- Longtermism (Effective Altruism)
- Space exploration (SpaceX)
- Pediatric research

Nietzsche's Ubermensch:
- psychological superiority
- have mastery over own emotions
- take joy in simply existing
- create, above all else
- confront society's culture and values, breaking their chains by creating his own values
- free spirit

How to become superhuman (3 metamorphosis):
- Be a Camel: "what is most diffucult to bear, that I may take it upon myself and exult in my inner strength?"
   ask to take the heaviest burden for the longest distance in lonely harsh deserts
   Take very seriously the Dragon (society's rules and moral codes (like: all men are created equal with some inelienable rights, care for your nieghbour, turn the other cheek, the golden rule: do onto others as you would have being done onto you, the right to have and express one's own opinion, tolerance for diversity, condemn violence, be polite, study, work, have kids - be a decent human being)), trying to be a role-model in moral integrity and honor.
   Be a good person, for real: be the extreme who obeys to the letter society's values.
   Be a role-model with a set of strong true values. Live up to yuor ideals, not up to the current fashion.
   - Set your values based on what is good and bad to you, and who you admire.
   - Then learn deeply how to live your values, your personal Dragon.
   BUT the Camel is only a nice guy. He's an excellent rule-follower and player in the Matrix. He's good but not free from his self-imposed jail.
   Wake up and realize it is meaningless to live according to someone else's values.
   Break free from the matrix. Be a LION.
   
- Be a Lion: "who is the Dragon that is no longer a Lord or God, saying "YOU SHOULD" to the Camel? The Lion says "I WILL"".
  The Lion confronts the Dragon. For every "you should", the Lion says NO. Categorically destroying all values, and with them an oppressive relationship or a morally compromising job.
  Both the Camel and the Lion are reactions to one's values: one positive, one negative.
  You need to find your own meaning and individual mission in life, independent of your environment. To do so, you have to go through this rebellious phase.
  The Dragon is the result of millennia of human wisdom, but is the enemy of true self-mastery.
  The Lion kills any oppressor, being committed to his own freedom: to express his individuality at its fullest.
  The Lion is self-consciousness: being aware of your own independent power.
  To become a real free spirit, you must fight against anyone who tries to limit your freedom.
  Confronting society, you might find yourself alone, but free: jobless, single, godless, stateless.
  BUT the Lion can only create freedom for itself, it cannot create new values.
  To create its own values, the Lion must become the Child.
  
- Be a Child: "for the game of Creation, a sacred "YES" is needed. The spirit who had been lost in the world, now wills hiw own will, conquering his own."
  The Child is the continuous Creator of new values, new beginnings.
  The Child has no resentments, forgets the past, creates a new present and a brighter future.
  The Child wills his own will, creates his own personal path, and never imposes his own values to anyone else.
  Like for Eraclitus, the Universe is in an eternal state of becoming.
  Get in touch with the child you were when you were playing. 
  Love life, beyond good and evil - just for life's own sake.
  Follow your own personal rules of playing this game of life.
  Pure creativity. In a Flow state.
  No restrictions: all is possible.
  YES to life: a self-propelling wheel full of innocence, forgiveness, own rule-creation.
  The Goal of life is to create - and, ultimately, to create the Superhuman.
  Be confident, affirmative, creative, forever change and develop, be in flow.
  Don't fixate on any specific identity (talk, dress, behave a certain way): you choose your own way continuously.
  You can change your decisions any moment as you please.
  Do Flow activities.
  Let go of any blockers to flow activities.
  Take life not too seriously, experiment more!
  Try new ways of behaving in order to achieve the flow state.
