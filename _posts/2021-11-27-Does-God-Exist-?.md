We could start by saying that we don't really know.
But the difficulty to express this idea should not prevent us from knowing it.

Do you believe in God?
This is a better question because it acknowledges that God's existence is much less a logical or objective truth, and much more a spiritual and subjective conscious experience.

There seems to be an infinite richness, beauty, validity, importance and meaning to illogical thoughts.
Things like imagination, fear, dreams, belief and love are not necessarily strictly logical or rational.

If doubt is the most extreme version of critical rationality, faith is the opposite.
We say that you "fall in love", or that you "take a leap of faith": the very acts of falling or taking a leap into the unkown are fundamentally irrational and absolutely risky things to do.

God's existence is not necessarily just a matter of objective reason: it is a matter of subjective conscious experience.
Like love, faith is limitlessly powerful and it is irrational: there lies its power.

Faith in God means faith in all that is grander and uncontrollable by the subjective experiencer: nature, time, life, destiny.
From this subjective experiencer's point of view - which is necessarily the only true point of view for me -, a belief in an idea can be so powerful that it becomes faith in the idea: the unquestionable trust in something grander and uncontrollable.
This trust in the unknown, this faith, can grow stronger overtime - by being continuously confirmed and reinforced by ascribing everything that is perceived as outside one's control as a direct or indirect function of God - and gradually (or suddenly) solidify what is perceived as - and therefore is - knowledge of truth.

This approach to one's worldview and subjective conscious experience shapes one's mind and actions, dignifies the significance of one's beliefs and actions in a World where things outside one's control have a major, continuous, persistent impact on one's life - and ultimately gives meaning to life.

So, are you the person who holds onto logic and reason to attempt to explain something objectively, or are you the person who surrenders to the reality of irrational and uncontrollable forces shaping all things, thus *choosing to see* the unkown, to accept it and to inscribe everything into it?

In one's course of life, we usually start by believing in magic, in the mysterious forces of the world, in an invisible sense of wonder, curiosity and awe towards the world, as children.
Growing up, most people then tend to rationalize their way out of all religious dogma and tend to see a weak thesis around the spiritual dimension of life, although some still like to cling onto it as their mind and spirit are more drawn to a feeling of completeness and purpose that is missing from the everyday preoccupations their conscious experience is full of. Put another way, some people look for the Yin in their Yang.
But even the non-religious and non-spiritual people, in those rare and most profound moments of their existence - ie. when faced with tragedy as the loss of a loved one or in a contemplating moment on their final days - will wonder if, in fact, God was there all along the way.

Whether it is the few really great scientists, artists or sportsmen, **the great human lives are generally lead by individuals who believe in God with strong faith**.
For example: Albert Einstein, Muhammad Ali, Ayrton Senna.
For individuals like these, there is no need to search for a concrete proof of God's existence even if they constantly look for it, because ultimately God's existence is the very sense of their own existence.
God for these individuals is better understood as the ideal highest version of themselves - of their soul - and is addressed in private prayer, as it resides in the better parts of the spirit.
Necessarily therefore, God is to be *experienced* and not to be investigated.

The reason for this I think is deep and simple: **the individual will to live is as strong as the faith in a greater power to realize it**.
The will equals the faith. Controllables and uncontrollables mesh together.
Forward and backward tendencies in time converge into making what is now present.

In life, things are done by you, but also to you: therefore all things end up happening through you, and ultimately as you.

**The coming of fate conduces to see why God exists.**

**God is the sense of reconciliation that consciousness seeks to maintain between the known and the unknown.**

**Most of all, God is the unknown.**

Now, for practical purposes, I believe that if a key driver of living the human conscious experience is to overcome your fear of facing the risks of the unknown, then the belief that something "has your back" is fully functional in living a better life, because you are confident in a good outcome.
In other words, if you truly believe that everything is going to be fine because "God", "the universe", "karma", destiny or the unknown is taking care of it, then **God is an empowering and fulfilling belief in living the present moment with autotelic confidence and meaning**.

To hope, believe, have faith and know that fate is here: this takes perspective.
Fate coming, destiny being unrolled under the present, the self actualizing, reality unfolding, things being consciously alive seemingly and evidently manifest a deeper, grander truth.
What that truth is the confluent tension between will and fate, between control and surrender.
You can look down and also you can look up. Look backwards and forward. Look out and look in.
It is not found in a particular place, rather **God is found in the willful tension along the direction of faith into the unknown** - that tension of ultimate trust is the way in which God exists in the counscious experience.

The grander the scheme of ideas, the weaker the words are to grasp it, the more meaningful the idea.

Like in John Conway's *Game of Life*, a conscious mind is a pattern-perceiving, pattern-seeking combination of matter, energy, information.
A mind is an emergent pattern-seeking pattern, among a playingfield that is mostly made up of and populated by non-pattern-seeking patterns.
So all the mind seeks to be doing is to make all things so that there is tension in the world towards a totalistic answer that is God, giving retrospective meaning to the mind's inherent activity.

We are seeking answers to our questions, so there would better be a totalistic answer to our ultimate questions for our own existence to even mean anything at all.

Whereas the Christian God is personified and thought to be transcending of spacetime and into human affairs, Spinoza's God is immanent: present in and as all things, as all-things is what God is.

God's presence is literally evident in front of me and I could find it in all things: it is not a person who could phyisically transcend spacetime to create it, oversee it, judge it or intervene on it.
An interventionist God would in fact appear to be not plausible, as "*even God cannot change the past*" according to Agathon *(from Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics)*.

Through logic we can definitively conclude neither God's existence nor its absence.
Through faith we can see something more.

The idea of God exists.
God is, therefore God exists.

Look inside, look outside.
Look in your past, look in your future.
Look down to human affairs, look up to your ambitions.
It does not matter where you look - what matters is that you are looking.
Look now.

God being in our looking, in our seeking a sense of reconciliation with the whole of our nature, we have found it.
It's here, in this sense.

As you feel this sense, you are connecting to God - so much so that we are only to conclude one thing: it's you.

Since you are the God, you are free to choose to see and have for yourself that deep sense of connection.

Now to answer the question that has been posed in the beginning: *Does God exist?*
Do you believe?
