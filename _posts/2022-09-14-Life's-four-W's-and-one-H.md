Five questions form a storytelling framework - the four W's and one H:
- Who?
- When?
- What?
- How?
- Why?

A clear answering of these questions will usually frame a story, real or made up.

By framing the story of Life, this framework can clarify the foundational values of a worldview.

***Who* is you**.
You cannot escape from the identity of your consciousness.
Even when referring to someone else, *you* do the referring in your consciousness.
Even when being in any sort of unconscious state, the experimenter of any content is a more abstract and broader (even infinite) *you*.

***When* is now.**
You cannot escape from the present moment.
Even the past is a memory arising now.
Even the future is a thought arising in the present moment about some imaginary state of things that is different (or more entropic) than the ones already lived.
The flow of time being a persistent illusion, the conscious experience, as well as the unconscious experience, is *now*.
In fact, *now* is so inescapably present that the definition of time becomes void: outside of *now* there really is nothing.

***What* is the truth**.
The contents of this story are always what is true to be true or true to be false.
The naked facts are sterile and do not give birth to opinion.
What happens is what happens: the self-evident, naked, revealingly unashamed, tautological truth.
This begs the moral imperative for all conscious individuals to be real, be true, tell the truth.

***How* is kindness**.
The quality, style, manners, ways in which the truth happens in the story are beyond good and bad.
The ways in which stuff happens in the present moment are set by causality, casuality, fate: the resulting forces of the deterministic past, the play of chance, the advent of the fatalistic future.
The style expressed by these ways is only defined by one's perspective on life: pessimistic or optimistic, demotivating or empowering, bad or good, angry or kind.
Kindness is a moral choice that is grounded in positivity and brings beauty, peace and richness.

***Why* is courage**.
Ultimately, the reason for all this story, for Life and the Universe, for **being you now as kind truth**, is the reason why one's necessary self-expression is necessarily about having to overcome challenges, fight fears, take risks, be bold, have purpose, carry the burden of suffering with dignity.
With courage you take risks: if you fail you can learn by gaining wisdom from suffering, if you succeed you gain meaning, purpose and fulfillment.
Among all the virtues, Courage is the most important because it enables all the others.

Intellectually, courage drives the fundamental forces of curiosity and imagination.
These are foundational to running the show of reality, as the questions of "*why*" and "*what if*" open infinite doors, show you the true and the new, and start the infinite meta-framings that make up consciousness.

A coherent life conduct would be to always seek and report the truth with kind, compassionate, warm regards towards people and things because one bravely fights his fears.

This requires: **Self-awareness, mindfulness, honesty, kindness, courage.**

The universe is you, you are here now: Life as an a-temporal one-player game, played by the conscious experimenting experiencer who allows and makes things happen at the same time, is about honesty, kindness and courage.

Dos: Know yourself, be here now, tell the truth, be kind, be brave.

Don'ts: Don't estraniate people or things, don't be lost in thoughts, don't lie, don't be evil, don't panic.

I am here now, I face my fears with realness and grace, I tell the truth with kind words.

Life is a gift to me. I am a gift to Life.
