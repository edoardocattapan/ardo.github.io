Does God exist?

Let's start by saying that we don't know.

Do I believe in God?
This is a great question because it acknowledges that God's existence is much less a logical or objective truth, and much more a holistic and subjective one.

There seems to be an infinite richness, beauty, validity, importance and meaning to illogical thoughts.
Things like imagination, fear, dreams, belief and love are not necessarily strictly logical or rational.

The least rational idea of all is faith - as opposed to doubt.
We say that you "fall in love", or that you "take a leap of faith": the acts of falling or taking a leap into the unkown are fundamentally irrational and absolutely risky things to do.

God's existence is not necessarily just a matter of objective reason: it is a matter of subjective conscious experience.
Like love, faith is limitlessly powerful and it is irrational: there lies its power.

Faith in God means faith in all that is grander and uncontrollable by the subjective experiencer: nature, time, life, destiny.
From this subjective experiencer point of view - which is necessarily the only true point of view for me -, a belief in an idea can be so powerful that it becomes faith in the idea: the unquestionable trust in something grander and uncontrollable.
This trust in the unknown, this faith, can grow stronger overtime - by being continuously confirmed and reinforced by ascribing everything that is perceived as outside one's control as a direct or indirect function of God - and gradually (or suddenly) solidify what is perceived as - and therefore is - knowledge of truth.

This approach to one's worldview and subjective conscious experience shapes one's mind and actions, dignifies the significance of one's beliefs and actions in a World where things outside one's control have a major, continuous, persistent impact on one's life - and ultimately gives meaning to life.

So, are you the person who holds onto logic and reason to attempt to explain something objectively, or are you the person who surrenders to the reality of irrational and uncontrollable forces shaping all things, thus *choosing to see* the unkown, accept it and inscribe everything into it?


The great human lives are generally lead by individuals who have faith in God.

The reason is deep, abstract and simple: the individual will to live is as strong as the faith in a greater power of life to realize it.
The will equals the faith.
Forward and backward tendencies in time converge into making what is now.
In life, things are done by you, but also to you: therefore all things end up happening through you, and ultimately as you.

The coming of fate conduces to seeing why God exists.
To hope, believe, have faith and know that fate is here: this takes perspective.
Fate coming, destiny being unrolled under the present, the self actualizing, reality unfolding, things being consciously alive seemingly and evidently manifest a deeper, grander truth.
What that truth is is God being here now.
The grander the scheme of ideas, the weaker the words are to grasp it, the more meaningful the idea.
God is here, therefore God exists.

In fact, God being here, we are it.

Like in John Conway's **Game of Life**, a conscious mind is a pattern-perceiving, pattern-seeking combination of matter, energy, information.
A mind is an emergent pattern-seeking pattern, among a playingfield that is mostly made up of and populated by non-pattern-seeking patterns.
So all the mind seeks to be doing is to make all things so that there is tension in the world towards a totalistic answer that is God, giving retrospective meaning to the mind's inherent activity.

We are seeking answers to our questions, so there would better be a totalistic answer to our ultimate questions for our own existence to even mean anything at all.

Whereas the Christian God is personified and thought to be transcending of spacetime and into human affairs, Spinoza's God is immanent in all things as all-things is what God is.

God's presence is literally evident in front of me and I could find it in all things: it is not a person who could phyisically transcend spacetime to create it, oversee it, judge it, intervene or rule on it.
