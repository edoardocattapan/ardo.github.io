True freedom is felt when one realizes that no conclusion is definite, given the indefinite nature of reality.

Science is not based on observable results of objective, repeatable experiments, nor on the theories that are derived from those experiments: science is based on questioning assumptions which, by definition, are falsifiable.
So when in school we learn that an apple falls from the tree to the ground because of the law of gravity, then we acquire useful knowledge to make sense of the world around us, and we feel intellectually free in pondering why a bigger apple falls even faster on the ground.

But the true free thinker is the one who questions the assumptions further and further: "is the experiment truly repeatable?", "is there any observation bias?", "does the repeatability of the experiment justify the abstarction of a general scientific theory?", "would the same experiment be repeatable outside of our planet? and outside of our observable universe?", "why do we call the apple with the name 'apple'?", "does this all matter?", "why?" and so on...

Any conclusion about anything is really just an attempt to consolidate the walls of our "castles made of sand", including this one of course.
