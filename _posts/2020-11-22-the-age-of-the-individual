We are only as free as the cages we live in.
If you don't build yourself a cage, someone else will gladly put you in theirs.

Freedom can only be enjoyed when constrained.
True freedom lies in the self-aware, disciplined engagement in one's life activities to be bounded by rules, constraints, restrictions and prohibitions.
The question is: who is building the cages you play in?

Whoever controls digital information has unparalleled power to constantly define what your cage is.

Privacy has become a topic of relevance because information is now continuously gathered in the most intimate and private confinements of our lives.
In the information age, digital surveillance is alive and well.
Your phone has ears and eyes that are constantly receptive, even when you turn the device off, and its brain is much bigger and more efficient than yours: everything is recorded and stored for as long as silicon chips and servers are working and preserved at cold temperatures.

Saying you have nothing to hide is stupid.
Because the information that is collected from you is used to keep your attention longer: in this time your brain is fed information that it will use to make decisions, big and small.
So when you share private information in chats, social media, or even when your phone is turned off in you pocket, you are giving away the power to guide your thinking, beliefs, actions: ultimately, your self.

The digital information you feed your brain everyday, directly or indirectly, is what primarily informs your decisions, big and small.
That digital information, when tied to machine learning models for artificial intelligence, like recommendation engines in social media, search and the news, is not being offered following criteria of innocence, impartiality, truth, or even usefulness: it is offered to you based on what will keep your attention and suck your time the most.

Your attention is everything.

So how much less independence, less control and less freedom are you willing to give away in exchange for more entertainement and more surveillance from supercomputers?
This does not sound like a good bargain, nor a fair one.

Some people realize that privacy is important, because the freedom to be yourself is important and because self-direction (the autonomy to make decisions and shape your worldview) is important.

A few people decide to act and fight for this belief.

Not protesting while acting as the victims of Big Tech companies or authoritarian governments; not holding signs of protest and shouting in the streets as many people like to do: this is useless theatre, not real fighting.
The way you fight is you defend against external threats and you create or become something that will annihilate or render obsolete the powers of your enemies.

Defence:
- delete mainstream social media accounts
- redirect your traffic anonymously through VPNs and the Tor network
- only use E2E-encrypted chats and calls

Attack:
