I believe in human agency.
The past is a story we tell ourselves built upon the memories we have and any documental witnesses accumulated, which we get to interpret subjectively.
The future is another story we imagine and choose to project toward an unkown place, a state of things where things are different than we can remember or acknowledge from the present situation.
From here, with this sense of framing our condition of living life, destiny is a void concept.

Humans can choose what reality to live in life by choosing what to believe, to think, to do.

Human agency originates reality, changes reality, legitimizes everything. It is the necessary condition for life.
At least for us, humans.


So choose.
Choose what you think, what you believe, what you do.
Choose the interpretation of the past and choose how to tell the story of the future.
Change the story at any time. Regardless of blocking pressures you may feel in certain moments (any pressure from peers or authorities), you choose.
Choose well. Then Act.
