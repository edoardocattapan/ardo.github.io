What is the purpose of life?

I have here previously tried to arrive at a conclusion: *"the purpose of life, then, is to be an artist: to create pockets of harmonious order for other people to enjoy. And life itself is the opportunity to make our greatest work of art: its meaning is to show how we choose to bear the necessary suffering."*

But perhaps trying to define one's own life purpose is like trying to find one's destiny: they are a-posteriori retrospective summatory perspectives on what one has been doing with the present moment all along.
You can only connect the dots looking backwards, and you can only live in the present moment.

So, as it is lived, the purpose of life should be the purpose of the present moment - to make the most out of it, to live in flow: with awareness, enjoyment, ordering the information that enters your consciousness with gratitude, discerning what is within and without your control, engaging in activities that match your challenges to your skills and balance them between anxiety and boredom in a way that is useful to the fulfillment of some clearly defined greater goal, serving the present moment by carrying yourself with virtue, developing yourself and adding value to others, doing what you love and loving what you do, being in a state of perfect knowledge of the reality of your situation, perfect efficaciousness and perfect economy of energy of thought, emotion and action (*wu wei*).

To live in a state of *flow* is what is important from a perspective of an individual's psychological mechanics or conscious experience.
**The purpose of the present moment is be to be in flow** - as defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

For a moment - or a life - of flow to be meaningful, there needs to be the fulfillment towards a purpose that is greater than one's life: to help advance a good cause that is mutually believed in by the individual and his people.

This is so, because the individual dies but his people, his species, and Life itself do not die with him.
So the contribution to Life - be it conscious or not, human or not, "civilized" or not -, the individual being a very small part of it, is to be a good part of it.
"Good" means closer to evoking feelings of joy, peace, love, unity according to one's own personal judgement - and it means "useful" according to other people.
And to do so silently and humbly - knowing that entitlement and virtue-signaling to play finite games of social status are really only misallocations of attention and merit.

Be it given or self-generated, **the meaning of one's life is that it be lived with a meaning**, even if that is to search for it or to renounce it.
Whatever topic that meaning might revolve around, all that is really essential is that **the conscious experience is pleasantly ordered** in a way that, at any moment and at any rate, non-controllable things are accepted and employed, while controllable resources are consciously chosen and allocated, to the achievement of one's chosen goals and mission of advancing a good cause.

The purpose can coincide with the meaning.
This can then be defined essentially as to feel joy and fulfillment in existing.
**To gift life back to Life through your actions and thoughts and feelings.**
To live in a state of flow, removing blockers to achieving the flow state.
To have inner moral integrity, intellectual honesty, the ability to learn and be self-reliant, and like in the book *The Surrender Experiment* by Michael Singer, to dissolve the "*ego*" by flowing with Life as Life itself, to forgive and let go, never fixate on anything specific, be open, build, experiment, to accept, appreciate, to change perspectives and assumptions, to create, to develop, to play. To have fun in doing so.

To create, as in Nietzsche's child metamorphosis.
To play.
To be a self-propelling wheel full of innocence, forgiveness and own rule-creation.
To be confident, affirmative, creative, forever change and develop, be in flow.
To not fixate on any specific identity (talk, dress, behave a certain way): you choose your own way continuously and can change decisions as you see fit.
To confront things as they are and stay a free spirit.
To do flow activities.
To let go of any blockers to flow activities.
To take life not too seriously, to experiment more.
To try new ways of behaving in order to achieve the flow state.
To flow in a universe that is in a perpetual state of becoming.
To have mastery over one's emotions.
To take joy in simply existing and creating.

Flow requires to gradually take the focus outside of yourself and towards your surroundings.
You can better see and know yourself if you get that the place to look is where your psyche lives: in the present moment more than behind your eyes.
Not even darkness or nothingness can describe the feeling of closing your eyes and looking behind them: you can't.
A knife cannot cut itself, it can only what is immediately next to it.
The self cannot see itself, but only see the present moment: the situationality of the opportunities in the immediate surroundings of space and time.
So if you spend much time and focused effort in trying to know yourself, you might accumulate a lot of insights on who you were until today, but if you are not doing anything else than self-introspection, your self gets stale and at some point you will meet your own gaze into it.

Thus to know yourself, to use your talents, passions, values, goals to serve others.

If this is the way, as an example for defining one's purpose, I try here firsthand to outline some insights from my own personal understanding of myself.

I love sailing, investing and learning because I am open, smart and curious.
I am talented at thinking abstractly and analytically and at focusing.
I enjoy expressing the virtues of honesty, courage and kindness. The last two forming the binomial compound of love: strength and warmth.
I would like other people to recognize my honesty, courage and kindness.
Honesty is not only telling the truth but also being real and morally and intellectually coherent.
Love is courage (being curious, brave, inquisitive, intentional) and kindness (respecting, helping, giving).
I enjoy expressing these qualities by intentionally trying to help others by speaking and writing, engaging in bold actions like impactful entrepreneurial venturing, and in my way of being peaceful and intense.

My most joyous moments have been in winning sailing championships and in speaking publicly.
My visions are to win sailing world championships, to speak publicly in a world stage, to live with my family in a big modern home by the sea or lake, to have a billions-dollar networth.

My north-star is the flow state: to pleasantly and effectively order my conscious experience.

I care for truth.
To seek it, to preserve it, to enjoy it.
This is why my most important values, coupled as of intellect and of action, are: curiosity and courage (to seek truth), honesty and resilience (to keep truth), humor and kindness (to enjoy truth).

In a perfect world I see everyone being honest and loving (having courage and being kind), saying things like "*we agree this is true, so let's do it!*". Truth of intellect and of action.

I would then fight my inner evils: falsehood and hate.
Falsehood includes social drama, hypocrisy, superficiality, lies, white lies (of omission), fakeness.
Hate includes being too self-centered, rude, and feeling like a pessimistic, bored, passive victim.

**Therefore my life's purpose would be to intentionally help others care more about truth and love through practicing honesty, courage and kindness by speaking and writing my abstract thoughts, winning sailing championships and building bold entrepreneurial ventures.**

One or a few *good causes* can then be chosen to align this purpose towards something specific to work for and improve.

But this whole endeavor of finding the purpose or the meaning of life, or to know how to go about creating it, really seems to reside on the airy grounds where the big difficult and possibly impossible-to-answer-correctly questions - like paradoxes - seem to reside.

On the concluding stages of this search, given the absence of a good-enough answer to "what is the meaning of life?", it only makes sense to not settle: to keep asking the question in different and new ways in order to understand the issue better and increase the chance of finding a good-enough answer.
This means to be curious abouth the nature of the Universe, and therefore to aim at getting a better understanding of the Universe, to keep asking better questions about the Universe for as long as possible, for which it is a necessary condition to increase the scale of consciousness (biological and digital) over time and space. This in turn means to have more computing power (brains and machines) dedicated to this searching endeavour. For this to more likely take place, one can try things like having children, manufacture hardware and write software for computers, maximize the likely lifespan of humanity and therefore decrease the chances of a bad future for humanity, one where civilizations collapse and do not transfer their technological knowledge onwards or anyway detracting progress towards the endeavour.
For the curious individual, beyond asking the questions, having kids and using computers, the grander purpose is to be useful in enabling conscious human life to stay on the path of better understanding the nature of the Universe, the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the given Universe.
To eventually understand the nature of the Universe - or to die trying - is the purpose of humanity as a whole.

This means to decrease the likelihood of humanity ever going extinct, at least during this endeavour, and to make sure curiosity and imagination thrive.
**To exist and ask "*why?*" and "*what if?*"**

For curiosity and imagination to thrive, one wants to make sure knowledge is accessible to as many people as possible, to see general education (arts, humanities and sciences), practical STEM subjects, the hard sciences, logic and the scientific method, as well as creative imagination and philosophy, as a fundamentally good thing to be enabled and incentivized for current and future generations.
To appreciate the long-term perspective, understanding that a conscious individual's life is only one very small and precious part of Life as a whole, across space and time.

**One chooses a *good* cause and works *hard* for advancing it.** *Hard*, because considerable force is required to get going and create order out of chaos while allocating resources and setting incentives in combating entropy and aging.

Good causes to advance:
- Liberal direct democracy (support RDI)
- Individual freedom & privacy (support Privacy International)
- Open knowledge (support Wikimedia Foundation and Endowment funds)
- STEM education (support Universities, research institutes, companies, individuals)
- AI safety (support OpenAI)
- Climate change (influence policies)
- Mental health (lower number of suicides)
- Global health (access to drinkable water, lower hunger, lower poverty, increase education, pandemic prevention)
- Longtermism (volunteer for Effective Altruism)
- Space exploration (support SpaceX)
- Pediatric research
- Animal rights & welfare

Moral values for a good future:
- Cosmopolitanism: being a global citizen standing for global unity and fraternity
- Longtermism: species-long (1M years) view, caring about the inter-generational equity for future generations
- Concern for non-human species: animal rights and welfare
- Consequentialism: moral choices don't come from following rules, but from considering the >2nd-order effects of our choices
- Liberalism: it is not granted that liberalism always trumps authoritarianism in practice

**So long as one exists, as a caretaker of the way of Nature, a self-generated purpose in life becomes to advance humanity's search for good answers and better questions by making sure that curiosity and imagination thrive, thereby asking and having others ask *"why?"* and *"what if?"*.**

To ask "why", you need a knowledge base to be addressed.
To ask "what if", you need permission to dream big and freedom to be wrong.
This is why I want to serve humanity by advancing the causes of open knowledge, free education and individual freedom above all.
In particular, I support Wikipedia, philosophy and STEM subjects, free markets, art, scientific research, entrepreneurship.
I also support direct democracy and individual privacy.

How one does these things is how one does anything: striving to practice the values of honesty, courage and kindness dignifies the care for truth and love. Ultimately, my undertakings of honest philosophical enquiry and of brave and kind actions can inspire others on our common endeavour.

Of course, the paradoxic and truest answer to the question *"why?"* is the answer *"because."*
And the truest ultimate answer to *"what if?"* is *"yes and..."*.
**Curiosity and imagination are limitless and fundamental.**
That is why they seem to be fundamental pursuits to be actively and purposefully enacted in the natural way of Life.

Finally, realizing that **lasting happiness happens when the meaning of daily actions is to fulfill a bigger purpose**, it would follow that one is to know what matters most to him and to the world, to know where he is going, and to take daily doses of actions in alignment with these.

Life is a series of connected choices: who I am, what I believe, what I do.
In other words, my purpose determines who I am, my values determine what I believe, my actions determine what I do.
My purpose is a dynamic - kind of "emergent" - confluence which results from my living my identity, values and actions.

Therefore, we can bring the questions of purpose, meaning and happiness into a converging question:
**What is the single most meaningful thing for me and for the world that I can do in my life, such that by doing it everything else becomes easier or unnecessary?**

What is most meaningful to me?
What is most meaningful to my family and community, to society, to civilization, to humanity, to the Universe?
What change do I want to see in the world?
What is most important to me?
What can I do?

For me, these questions lead to my answer:
**To be a good person by exemplarily taking daily and historical acts of honesty, courage and kindness.**

Now, why are you here in the world?
What if you were never born?
