What is the purpose of life?

Trying to define one's own life purpose is like trying to find one's destiny: they are a-posteriori retrospective summatory perspectives on what one has been doing with the present moment all along.

So, as it is lived, the purpose of life should be the purpose of the present moment - to make the most out of it, to live in flow: with awareness, enjoyment, in a way that is useful to the fulfillment of some greater goal, serving the present things that we control with virtue, to develop yourself and add value to others, to do what you love and love what you do.

To live in a state of *flow* is what is important from a perspective of an individual's psychological mechanics.
**The purpose of the present moment is be to be in flow** - as defined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.

For a moment - or a life - of flow to be meaningful, there needs to be the fulfillment towards a purpose that is greater than one's life: to help advance a good cause that is mutually believed in by the individual and his people.

This is so, because the individual dies but his people, his species, and Life itself do not die with him.
So the contribution to Life - be it conscious or not, human or not, "civilized" or not -, the individual being a very small part of it, is to be a good part of it.
"Good" means closer to evoking feelings of joy, peace, love, unity according to one's own personal judgement - and it means "useful" according to other people.
And to do so silently and humbly - knowing that entitlement and virtue-signaling to play finite games of social status are really only misallocations of attention and merit.

Be it given or self-generated, **the meaning of one's life is that it be lived with a meaning**, even if that is to search for it or to renounce it.
Whatever topic that meaning might revolve around, all that is really essential is that **the conscious experience is pleasantly ordered** in a way that, at any moment and at any rate, non-controllable things are accepted and employed, while controllable resources are consciously chosen and allocated, to the achievement of one's chosen goals and mission of advancing a good cause.

The purpose can coincide with the meaning.
This can then be defined essentially as to feel joy and fulfillment in existing.
To live in a state of flow, removing blockers to achieving the flow state.
To have inner moral integrity, intellectual honesty, the ability to learn and be self-reliant, and like in the book *The Surrender Experiment* by Micahel Singer, to forgive and let go, never fixate on anything specific, be open, build, experiment, to accept, appreciate, to change perspectives and assumptions, to create, to develop, to play. To have fun in doing so.

To create, as in Nietzsche's child metamorphosis.
To play.
To be a self-propelling wheel full of innocence, forgiveness and own rule-creation.
To be confident, affirmative, creative, forever change and develop, be in flow.
To not fixate on any specific identity (talk, dress, behave a certain way): you choose your own way continuously and can change decisions as you see fit.
To confront things as they are and stay a free spirit.
To do flow activities.
To let go of any blockers to flow activities.
To take life not too seriously, to experiment more.
To try new ways of behaving in order to achieve the flow state.
To flow in a universe that is in a perpetual state of becoming.
To have mastery over one's emotions.
To take joy in simply existing and creating.

To gradually take the focus outside of yourself and towards your surroundings.
You can better see and know yourself if you get that the place to look is where your psyche lives: in the present moment more than behind your eyes.
Not even darkness or nothingness can describe the feeling of closing your eyes and looking behind them: you can't.
The knife cannot cut itself, but only what is immediately next to it.
The self cannot be itself, but only be the present moment: the situationality of the opportunities in the immediate surroundings of space and time.

As an example for defining one's purpose, I outline below insights on my own personal understanding of myself.

I love sailing, investing and learning because I am open, smart and curious.
I am talented at thinking abstractly and analytically and at focusing.
I enjoy expressing the virtues of honesty, courage and kindness. The last two forming the binomial compound of love: strength and warmth.
I would like other people to recognize my honesty, courage and kindness.
Honesty is not only telling the truth but also being real and morally and intellectually coherent.
Love is courage (being curious, brave, inquisitive, intentional) and kindness (respecting, helping, giving).
I enjoy expressing these qualities by intentionally trying to help others by speaking and writing, engaging in bold actions like impactful entrepreneurial venturing, and in my way of being peaceful and intense.

My most joyous moments have been in winning sailing championships and in speaking publicly.
My visions are to win sailing world championships, to speak publicly in a world stage, to live with my family in a big modern home by the sea or lake, to have a billions-dollar networth.

My north-star is the flow state: to pleasantly and effectively order my conscious experience.

I care for truth.
To seek it, to preserve it, to enjoy it.
This is why my most important values, coupled as of intellect and of action, are: curiosity and courage (to seek truth), honesty and resilience (to keep truth), humor and kindness (to enjoy truth).

In a perfect world I see everyone being honest and loving (having courage and being kind), saying things like "*we agree this is true, so let's do it!*". Truth of intellect and of action.

I would then fight my inner evils: falsehood and hate.
Falsehood includes social drama, hypocrisy, superficiality, lies, white lies (of omission), fakeness.
Hate includes being too self-centered, rude, and feeling like a pessimistic, bored, passive victim.

**Therefore my life's purpose would be to speak and write publicly, win sailing championships and build bold entrepreneurial ventures to intentionally help others be more honest, have courage and be kind.**


But this whole endeavor of finding the purpose or the meaning of life, or to know how to go about creating it, really seems to reside on the airy grounds where the big difficult and possibly impossible-to-answer-correctly questions - like paradoxes - seem to reside.

On the concluding stages of this search, given the absence of a good-enough answer to "what is the meaning of life?", it only makes sense to not settle: to keep asking the question in different and new ways in order to understand the issue better and increase the chance of finding a good-enough answer.
This means to be curious abouth the nature of the Universe, and therefore to aim at getting a better understanding of the Universe, to keep asking better questions about the Universe for as long as possible, for which it is a necessary condition to increase the scale of consciousness (biological and digital) over time and space. This in turn means to have more computing power (brains and machines) dedicated to this searching endeavour. For this to more likely take place, one can try many things like having children, manufacturing harware and creating software for computers, maximize the likely lifespan of humanity, and therefore decrease the chances of a bad future for humanity, one where civilizations collapse and do not transfer their technological knowledge onwards or anyway with negative progress towards the endeavour.
For the curious individual, beyond asking the questions with honesty and rigour, having kids and using computers, the grander purpose is to be useful in enabling conscious human life to stay on the path of better understanding the nature of the Universe, the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is the Universe.
To eventually understand the nature of the Universe - or to die trying - is the purpose of humanity as a whole.

This means to decrease the likelihood of humanity ever going extinct, at least during this endeavour, and to make sure curiosity and imagination thrive.
**To exist and ask "*why?*" and "*what if?*"**

For curiosity and imagination to thrive, one wants to make sure knowledge is accessible to as many people as possible, to see general education (arts, humanities and sciences), especially STEM subjects and especially the hard sciences and the scientific method, as a fundamentally good thing to be enabled and incentivized for current and future generations.
To appreciate the long-term perspective, understanding that a conscious individual's life is only one very small and precious part of Life as a whole across space and time.

In this reasonably logical thread of deductions, one would conclude that there are practical things to do now for any individual that give him meaning and purpose towards a greater good.
These revolve around choosing a good cause and working hard for advancing it. *Hard* because considerable force is required to create order out of chaos in combating entropy and aging.

Causes to advance:
- liberal democracy (support RDI)
- individual freedom & privacy (support Privacy International)
- animal rights & welfare
- open knowledge (support Wikimedia Foundation and Endowment funds)
- STEM education (support Universities, research institutes, companies, individuals)
- AI safety (support OpenAI)
- Climate change
- Mental health (lower number of suicides)
- Global health & pandemic prevention
- Longtermism (volunteer for Effective Altruism)
- Space exploration (support SpaceX)
- Pediatric research

Moral values of today that can affect the next millennia:
- Cosmopolitanism: being a global citizen standing for global unity and fraternity
- Longtermism: species-long (1M years) view, caring about the inter-generational equity for future generations
- Concern for non-human species: animal rights and welfare
- Consequentialism: moral choices don't come from following rules, but from considering the >2nd-order effects of our choices
- Liberalism: it is not granted that liberalism always trumps authoritarianism in practice
