Exploration is innate in humans.
We like to go beyond what we already know, and always seek to adventure into new undiscovered territories.
It may be trying to discover new things by doing science, or creating new pieces of art, or physically going to new places.

When you move towards something, you are also moving away from something.

If you find yourself in the woods, you can choose to point a destination to walk towards or a landmark to walk away from.

When venturing into the unkown, you only know what you are moving away from.

Instead of seeking to be closer to some ideal place, a more grounded and effective strategy for you to manage your risk-taking venture might be to continually make sure that you are just moving away from a bad place.

Instead of seeking the mirage of truth, turn around for a second, and check if your last few aligned footsteps have been moving you further away from falsehood or telling lies.

Instead of seeking truth, try to be less wrong - it's a slower process, it requires more patience, faith and persistence to do the boring thing.
Instead of seeking honesty in yourself, try to tell fewer lies to yourself.
