Exploration is innate in humans.
We like to go beyond what we already know, and always seek to adventure into new undiscovered territories.
It may be trying to discover new things by doing science, or creating new pieces of art, or physically going to new places.

When you move towards something, you are also moving away from something else.

When you walk in the woods you can choose to point to a destination and walk towards it, or have a landmark and walk away from it through every step you take.

When venturing into the unkown, you only know what you are moving away from.

Instead of seeking to be closer to some ideal unkown place, a more grounded and effective strategy for managing the risks of your venturing might be to continually make sure that you are making progress away from a starting place you already know is bad.

Instead of seeking the mirages of truth, wisdom, perfect beauty or enlightenment, turn around for a second, and check if your last footsteps are aligned to move you further away from what you know is false, foolish, ugly or dark.

Since you are generally faulty and wrong most of the time, try to be less wrong: it's a slow and steady process, it requires diligence and patience to keep on doing the boring thing.

Instead of seeking to be more honest, try to tell fewer lies to yourself.

Instead of trying to focus your attention on only one thing, eliminate everything else.
