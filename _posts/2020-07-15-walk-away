Exploration is innate in humans.
We like to go beyond what we already know and always seek to adventure into new undiscovered territories.
It may be physically going to new places, trying to discover new things by doing experiments, or creating new art.

But when you move towards something - anything - you are also moving away from something else.
For example, when you walk in the middle of the woods you can choose to point to a destination and walk towards it, or have a landmark and walk away from it through every step you take.
And when venturing into the unkown, you only know what you are moving away from.

Instead of seeking to get closer to some imagined unkown place, a more grounded and effective approach for managing the risks of your venture might be to just continually make sure that you are making progress, through every single step, away from a starting place which you already know is bad.

Instead of seeking the mirages of truth, wisdom, perfect beauty or enlightenment, turn around for a second now, look back and check if your last few footsteps seem aligned to be moving you further away from what you know is false, foolish, ugly or dark.

Since you generally are faulty and wrong most of the time, try to be less wrong: it's a slow, steady and boring process requiring diligence and patience to just keep on doing the right thing.

Instead of seeking to be more honest, try to tell fewer lies to yourself.

Instead of trying to focus your attention on only one thing, eliminate everything else.

When the unkowns are overwhelming, you can always try to invert the challenge at hand and perceive your venture as a progression away from the dark points of your reality.
The alignment of your last footsteps are a measure of your effectiveness to make things better for the future.
