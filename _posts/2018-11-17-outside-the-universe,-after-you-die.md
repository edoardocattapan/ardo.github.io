When I was in high school, a physics professor from university came to our school to give a fascinating lecture about "The Infinitely Big and The Infinitely Small".
After the professor gave the lecture, one of the smartest students in the school, who was also the school's students' representative, asked the lecturer: "if the universe is expanding (at accelerated speed) like an air baloon, then where is it expanding into? what's outside the expanding universe? just infinite space?"
And I remember being shocked at the stupidity of his question, as he had serious trouble accepting the idea that "space" only makes sense as space-time within the universe, and not without it.

His question was based on the false assumption that space is something independent of the space-time fabric of the universe, when in fact the accelerating "expansion" of the universe is perhaps best described with a metaphor: if you live in a 2-dimensional world (like a cartoon character inside a piece of paper) and suddenly a point appears out of nowhere in your world and as you keep watching, you see the point expanding into a circle, with its circumference becoming bigger and bigger, this could be explained as a 3D cone figure penetrating through your 2D world in which you live, and since all you know is 2D, you see a circle expanding, when in fact there is a 3D cone maintaining its shape but moving through your world.

By the way, this is also a great way to explain why the flow of time is really just an illusion: individual things in reality are not performing a movement (or dance) through time, but rather our perception moves (sheds light) from one dance move to the next one.
Everything already exists: our perception is zooming in-and-out of a fractal-like and chaotic structure of information.
In this sense, eveything we see here in our Universe whose behaviour we cannot explain with the current knowledge we have at hand could be explained by "projections" of moving multi-dimensional structures into our 3D fabric of reality.

As we ask "what's outside the universe?", or similarly "what's before the Big Bang?", we might ask "what happens after death?"

Based on the theory of biocentrism, which encapsulates the latest scientific findings in physics and biology, we realize that this question too is based on a false assumption: that time is independent of life and consciousness.

Like the universe does not expand into space, as space-time is inherent within the universe and not outside of it, so life does not develop within time, as time is inherent in the consciousness of a living organism.
When you will die, everything ceases to exist for you.
Your death is the end of biological life, as your consciousness shuts off annihilating literally eveything, including the idea of time.
In other words, you are like a computer shutting down: the software is no longer running.
So interestingly enough, if I happen to "outlive" you by dying on a later date, it does not mean that time has passed: neither for you, nor for me, nor for anybody anywhere.

When his old collaborator and friend Michele Besso died, Albert Einstein wrote:
"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me.
That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."

If there is no distinction between past, present and future, then the flow of time does not make sense and everything happens in the eternal present moment.
But the present moment is not to be conceived as an infinitesimally small point of time (a moment) which is ever-present as "time goes on":  rather as the a-temporal "eternal moment", during which everything that ever was, is or will be, is.
If this reasonates and is true, then we realize that what we call "the future" is already existing in the present moment all along and we are just not having access to it.
As writer William Gibson once put it on The Economist: “The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed."

On top of this revelation, some theories have built persuasive stories of metaphorical and iconoclastic myths, such as Christianity, around the promise of eternity.
The late Friedrich Nietzsche has brilliantly revealed the psychopathology behind Christianity, as he charged it with nihilism because of its lust for sacrifice and revenge which radically depreciates the only life we certainly do have in this world for the sake of an unknown "afterlife".
Although Nietzsche ended up proposing yet another alienating atheistic theology based on the eternal recurrence of life - an idea based on the cyclical nature of time first brought forward by the Pythagoreans in ancient Greece - we could very reasonably stop here and conclude that life and consciousness are indeed the origin of everything.

We don't need to find new ways to transcend life - although I welcome that - because we already do.

See: life actually ends with death, and there is nothing on the other side.
Everything (everything) is necessarily on this side.

I live. Forever shall I live.

Your life really is everything.
