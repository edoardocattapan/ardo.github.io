Ideas that create a powerful mindset:

- There is no time: only the present moment. Be present now. You are this moment. As this moment, you stop being self-conscious and *let* yourself be as things flow through you.
Like the athlete in the *zone*, you *let* yourself free to make the effort of creating this moment.

- Accept the uncontrollable as passing through you, focus only on controlling your own perspective on conscious experience.

- Watch yourself be the agent. You are the author and spectator at the same time. From the depth of your mind, just *watch yourself* do things. Let your act unfold. Let what you are be, let reality happen.

- Look at what you have around you as an ungranted beautiful free gift that you can use, or as yourself.

- Be fire. Wild passion at the core, that grows and lights up everything around it. Anything, whether made to stop you or not, goes through your ghosting gasses and converted to nurture you.

- Breathe smoothly and rythmically. Know you are being aware of everything in the present moment. Be aware of your present character, as in third-person, like a videogame player feels for his videogame character:
does he feel angry? you want to make him resolute. Does he feel sad? you want to feel compassion for him. Does he feel jealous? You want to make him change.

- Be simple and content.
