Ideas that create a powerful mindset:

- There is no time: only the present moment. Be present now. You are this moment.

- Accept the uncontrollable as passing through you, focus only on controlling your own perspective on conscious experience.

- Watch yourself be the agent. You are the author and spectator at the same time. From the depth of your mind, just *watch yourself* do things. Let your act unfold.

- Look at what you have as an unnecessary beautiful gift that you can use.

- Be simple and content.
