A fundamental axiom in my worldview and lifestyle, which I admit I forget sometimes, is that the passing of time is not real.

Time exists: it is a directionality of duration, an arbitrary variable we choose to interpret reality and make sense of it.
But the passing of time from our standpoint is an illusion: the objective, measurable, irreversible flow of time is, indeed, a stubbornly persistent illusion.

Life is a one-player game, which each of us plays inside of his own subjective conscious experience.
When you play well at the game of life, everything flows effortlessly and you feel one with your present circumstances.
This is called flow.
This flow is a beautiful modality of experiencing your consciousness and its contents: time is out of the equation.

In fact, all psychological suffering is based on the illusory separation of past, present and future, as well as on the illusory separation of separate bodies inside a 3D environment.
These separations are convenient as labels. But Nature knows nothing of these conceptual separations.

One thing is to know something, another thing is to know the name of something. (quote feynman)

We only live in the present.
Everything we ever had (and will ever have) is right here, right now.

This inescapable truth is easily forgotten when living everyday life: we like "remembering" the past and "planning" the future.

When you - effortlessly, but consciously - feel mindful of all the conditions of the present moment in your life (at each and every moment), you just avoid putting your attention to the creation of tangent stories about the "past" or the "future", leaving only one place for your attention to go: right here, right now.

Now the mind is working efficiently, as it feels open to receive multiple inputs and to create connections.
Opportunity and creativity are born here, as well as enjoyment of one's conscious experience and a sense of self-fulfillment.
