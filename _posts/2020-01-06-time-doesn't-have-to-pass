A foundational axiom of my worldview is this: **the flow of time is an illusion**.

I admit I sometimes forget it, because in my everyday life the passing of time is, from my standpoint, a very persistent illusion.

For me time does exist, as the directionality of duration: an arbitrary variable which we use to quickly interpret reality and make sense of it.
But the characterization of time with its absolute, objective, measurable and irreversible flowing is, indeed, a "stubbornly persistent illusion" (Einsten).

Life is a one-player game, which each of us plays inside of his own subjective conscious experience.
When you play well at the game of life, everything flows effortlessly and you feel one with your present circumstances.
This is called flow.
This flow is a beautiful modality of experiencing your consciousness and its contents: time is out of the equation.

In fact, all psychological suffering is entirely based on the illusory separation of past, present and future, as well as on the illusory separation of separate bodies inside a 3D environment.
These two mental models, of separation in time and in space, are convenient as labels for our sense-making minds.
But Nature knows nothing of these conceptual frames of separation.

One thing is to know something, another thing is to know the name of something. (quote feynman)

We only live in the present.
Everything we ever had (and will ever have) is right here, right now.

This inescapable truth is easily forgotten when living everyday life: we like "remembering" the past and "planning" the future.

When you - effortlessly, but consciously - feel mindful of all the conditions of the present moment in your life (at each and every moment), you just avoid putting your attention to the creation of tangent stories about the "past" or the "future", leaving only one place for your attention to go: right here, right now.

Now the mind is working efficiently, as it feels open to receive multiple inputs and to create connections.
Opportunity and creativity are born here, as well as enjoyment of one's conscious experience and a sense of self-fulfillment.

How can you live life if time really doesn't pass?

Well, instead of the flow of time, we simply choose another variable to mentally extrapolate from the world and use it explicitly to view the world, and act *as* it (not *in* it).

Since we are conceptually free, now, from the known conventions, why not choose something good?
What about conceiving everything now, from the unifying perspective of love?
