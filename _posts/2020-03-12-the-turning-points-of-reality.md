In the geometry of reality, some points are much more interesting than most others.
Rare, single points where reality resolves itself in interesting ways: a scapegoat, a saddle point, a portal.

A scapegoat is usually the weakest and strongest member of a community (be it a group of people or a set of ideas): the single member which appears less equal than everybody else.
To everybody else, its distance from the average is singular enough to allow for unsolicited attacks to a practical target.
The scapegoat appears as the single member which is most vulnerable to coordinated attacks from within its group, thus - being a single member - unlikely to effectively oppose resistance against any multi-directional (not necessarily simultaneous) attack towards it.
Precisely for this perceived *absolute weakness* within its group, the scapegoat is the only single member in the group who is possibly capable of resolving all the violence within the group by channelling it and taking the blame on itself.
Paradoxically, only who appears to be so strong a member as to be able to take on itself alone all the violence combined from within its group is a good candidate for scapegoating.

So if you are complaining about anything, or blaming somebody else, you know who you are: just another anonymous, uninteresting, unimportant, forgettable and totally negligible member of the community you found yourself in.
The really interesting people, as the interesting ideas, are usually the ones who can take all the blame on themselves: by appearing weak to others they demonstrate uncommon internal strength.

Another type of reality's turning points are saddle points.
A saddle point is one such that, just when you've hit rock bottom, you find yourself standing on the peak of a mountain.
A horseback is literally where a saddle point is found: riding a horse, you sit on the lowest point of its back and on the highest point of its torso.
A mountain pass is the lowest point between two mountain peaks which can only be reached by climbing the full altitude the local mountain peak.
The chaotic movement of the water can show local surface points where the trough of one wave coincides with the perpendicular crest of another.

From its longitudinal or latitudinal perspective, the bi-dimensionality of saddle points is the foundation for making an intersection of curves on perpendicular planes interesting at all.
In fact, saddle points are only a particular example of multi-dimensional intersections.

A more general instance of multi-dimensional intersection points is a portal.
A portal is something in this world that appears to be just like other common things, but is secretly a gateway door to other worlds.
Any access point into other dimensions necessarily has to exist at the intersection with the present dimensions one is in.
Some doors we can find in 3 dimensions are actually the gateways into new ways of perceiving and experiencing our multi-dimensional reality.
Such a door might look like a book, a movie, a drug, or a question that you can ask here, but you can't see all the answers from where you stand.

*"What an astonishing thing a book is. It's a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you're inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic."* - Carl Sagan

In the brain, mindfulness (or the interplay between left and right hemispheres) is a portal: the world of irrationality is accessed from a rational world, transporting our conscious perception from an ordered and logical world into a chaotic and irrational one, where rules are abandoned and things don't have to necessarily make sense as they did before.
For example, you might open a fiction book to read a few paragraphs, and could find yourself inhabiting imaginary worlds where changes in how you perceive time, space, order, rules and priorities give you a totally new conscious experience.
Portals can be found in many of our stories: Inception, Harry Potter's platform 9 and 3/4s, Alice in Wonderland's little door in the garden, the secret life of Walter Mitty, Charlie and the chocolate factory; or they might show themselves as psycho-active substances like LSD, light drugs, dreams, or just through our own imagination.
In these stories, portals are wardrobes, a looking glass, a rabbit hole, a platform in the train station, the clock hitting midnight in Paris, stroking the genie lamp, seeing the world through the lenses of a toy, a rat or a pet, and so on.
In mathemathics, a good example of a portal is the square root of negative 1: it exists within the realm of real numbers, and it brings us to a whole new dimension of imaginary numbers.
Another example might be virtual reality headsets: we can wear them, and suddenly our mind is overwhelmed with new logics of information which are other-worldly.

Almost by definition, these rare points found in reality are the precise locations where perspective is shifted: the moments of awe.
If at first glance they seem logical contradictions, through the embracing glance of a shifting perspective, the whole mind can recognize that paradoxes are the turning points of reality.
