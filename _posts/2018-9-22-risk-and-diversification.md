Risk is not a real thing.
Risk is a concept meaningful only in probabilistic terms.

Investment diversification is a protection against a fictional danger: the risk of a net loss of money from a set of investments.
This reasoning only holds true when talking about possible future outcomes in probabilistic terms.
In terms of real results, the outcome is always going to be one, meaning that risk-minimization through diversification of investments is a losing strategy, as it pulls away resources from the best performing investments and puts them into the worst performing ones.
Diversification as a hedging strategy against the risk of losing money comes from a lack of confidence in what to invest in, acting as a serious break to overall returns and as a serious limitation in independent thinking when choosing investments.

Diversification should come as a byproduct of investing convincingly in multiple things, and not as a fundamental strategy for hedging the risk of loss.
As investors, people shouldn't think of diversifying risk. They should focus on investing only in things they truly understand and believe are true through their own research and independent thinking.

As a rule of thumb, I think if one invests convincingly in 5 to 10 things he truly believes in, he does not have to worry about diversification.
