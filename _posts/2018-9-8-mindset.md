"Ten decisions shape your life. You'll be aware of five about" - I'll Try Anything Once, The Strokes.
For as much agency in as many decisions you might try to imprint to give shape to your own life, it certainly might seem as though most of life's critical decisions are not made by you, but by external circumstances which you cannot totally or directly control.
On top of this, as the song lyric goes, you might only be aware of just a few of those life-changing decisions.

Nonetheless, the only actor and constant spectator of this whole show that is your life is you.
And you have agency over a lot of important things, including how you interpret and react over the (apparently) life-changing decisions you didn't take.

The mindset with which you prime your mind for any decsion or activity is radically important in determining the outcomes in your life.
One's mindset directly determines a lot of life outcomes where direct agency is involved.

Attitude is a crucial aspect in explaining - and therefore a useful tool for predicting - one's outcomes in life, as well as for understanding many social phenomena.
Not only because mindset is a determining factor setting up one's attitude in approaching an activty, but because the very act of mind-setting (priming the mind for an activity) is also at the basis for interpreting the final result of that activity and judging whether that outcome is good or bad.
