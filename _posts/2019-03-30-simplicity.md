There is an overwhelming power in the simple things.

Simple things are so distinct from all those comparable, more complex alternatives, and have a unique esthetic elegance.
Most of all, simple things deliver pure emotions in the most direct way, without unnecessary ornaments or explanations.

Flowers.

Babies.

Water.

Air.

Colors.

A square.

A couple of people.

Sunlight.

Warm temperature.

Wind.

Music.

Simplicity always covers the essentials, and does so in the most sublime and elegant way possible.

In everyday life, simplicity is so powerful for the mind.

Dress simple clothes.

Eat simple food.

Drink water.

Feel happiness, feel love.

Talk about the simple things in a deep way.

Stay close to people.

Aim for good.

I really wish the world in my mind would frequently come back to that sense of essential, powerful simplicity.
