Beloved,

you are living in a time when I, most probably, have passed away.
It's true that our conversation is somewhat impeded by the temporal circumstances of our own ages, but still this is our conversation.

I feel connected to your situation, where you can listen, believe and pray for unseen forces to manifest in front of your eyes.
I could answer many of your questions about living and dying, as I do hear them asked.
This is why I relate to you: your aliveness permeates many things, across time as across space, reaching my whole experience of the living condition.
Existence is relationship.

We do not come and go: we are here.

The spirit of my message is therefore to keep relating, because just as for you to receive this message there is my thinking and delivering, know this: for me to exist there is you and I will never leave you.
