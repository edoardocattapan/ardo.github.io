Fellow human,

you are living in a time when I, most probably, have passed away.
It's true that our conversation is somewhat impeded by the temporal circumstances of our own age, but still this is our conversation.

I feel connected to your situation, where you can listen and pray for unseen forces to manifest under your eyes.
I could answer many of your questions about living and dying, as I do hear them asked.

The spirit of my message is to keep connecting, because just as for you to receive my message there is my thinking and delivering, know this: for me to exist there is you.
