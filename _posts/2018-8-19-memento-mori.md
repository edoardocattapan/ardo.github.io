We are not getting out of this life alive and well.

Rember: you will die.
Your body - as a biological aggregation of cells - is getting older and dying every moment passing in time.
Every moment brings your death closer.

The notion that death is inevitable and ever closer is scary, because it imposes on us something unkown and irreversible, and is sad, because whatever you do in life does not matter.
You can work hard towards huge plans for a great future, or you could do nothing for the future and spend the present moment appreciating (or depressingly downgrading) all you witness in your life.
As the song Undertow by Stars goes: "You pick the storm or you pick the shore: both take you to the floor".

However, I think the concept of "Memento mori" is truly empowering in putting things into perspective and in clarifying the nature, scope and meaning of our human dimension in this reality.

You realize you have nothing to prove to anybody, as the only people that might observe, judge or evere care about you and your actions are also all dying about the same time as you are.

Nobody cares about you. But you should care, because you are everything you will ever be in this only existence.

You also realize that you have nothing to hide from the world, as you are already totally exposed in the first place just by being here.
Being alive means you are in the light, on the playground, and you get to play for some time.
You are so fortunate to be doing this.
The chance of you being born and alive in this moment are pretty minuscule (nearly non-existent) in the bigger scheme of things.
Acknowledging this, the only thing that makes sense is to be grateful to chance that you even exist and play your turn at your only life.

In playing your life, you have no real risks.
So just play well, without any restraint in expressing yourself, and always take care of humanity as it is your family: your extended self which will continue to exist after you will be dead - at least for some time more.
