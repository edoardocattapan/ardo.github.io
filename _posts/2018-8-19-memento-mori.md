We are not getting out of this life alive and well.

You will die. Your body - as a biological aggregation of cells - is getting older and dying every moment passing in time. Every moment brings your death closer.

The notion that death is inevitable and ever closer is scary, because it imposes on us something unkown and irreversible, and is sad, because whatever you do in life does not matter. As the song Undertow by Stars says at the end: "You pick the storm or you pick the shore: both take you to the floor".

However, I think the concept of "Memento mori" is truly empowering in putting things into perspective and in clarifying the nature, scope and meaning of our human dimension in this reality.

You realize you have nothing to prove, and you have nothing to hide, because there are no such things in the first place.
Being alive means you are in the light, on the playground, and you get to play.
You are so fortunate to be doing this.
The chances of being born and alive in this moment are pretty minuscule in the bigger scheme of things.

In playing your life, you have no real risks. So just play well, without restraints in expressing yourself.
