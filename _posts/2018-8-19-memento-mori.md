We are not getting out of this life alive and well.

You will die. You are dying every moment passing in time.

The concept of "Memento mori" is truly empowering in putting things into perspective and in clarifying the nature, scope and meaning of your human dimension in this reality.

You realize you have nothing to prove, and you have nothing to hide, because there are no such things in the first place.
Being alive means you are in the light, on the playground, and you get to play.
You are so fortunate to be doing this.
The chances of being born and alive in this moment are pretty minuscule in the bigger scheme of things.

In playing your life, you have no real risks. So just play well, without restraints in expressing yourself.

You are going to die. Every moment brings your death closer. Remember that.
