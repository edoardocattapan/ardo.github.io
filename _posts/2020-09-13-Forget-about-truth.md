"He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else." - William Daniel Hillis on Richard Feynman

The human mind looks for new connections, patterns, relationships, structures, order.
Truth is not the primary motive of our thinking: it is only a utopical extreme version of realizing that there are no more patterns to be discovered.

The indirect search for truth is only a by-product of our relentless search for new things to update our cognitive and meta-cognitive structures, our models of order and maps of meaning.

Forget about truth, look for novelty.
Keep on searching for the new things.
