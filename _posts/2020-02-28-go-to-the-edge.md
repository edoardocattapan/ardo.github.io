There is no way of living which is ultimately perfect for the human condition.
Even accepting all your flaws, mistakes and shortcomings veils a real and miserable sense of guilt for yourself and a deep real disappointment over life.

There is no long-lasting ecstasy, no life-long sense of awe and bewilderment, no pure love that can last longer than a handful of moments.
It is true that we only live in moments, and that it is a choice whether we feel in love and awe or not.
But how much less true is it that we live in days, and in years, and in decades? And how much willful control do we really have within our own conscious experience to excercise ordered choices about how we feel?

Uncertainty is the condition of our experience.

The conscious experience can be so made in three: the mind, the spirit and the body. Three mechanisms of order immersed into chaos.
Like a planet traveling inside the infinite black empty space, at the edge of our three ordered mechanisms chaos surrounds everything to the point of impregnating the very conscious experience itself.

It is by fully facing chaos that the mind is free from what is already known.
It is by fully facing chaos that the spirit is alive and burning.
It is by fully facing chaos that the body can breathe and move.
It is by fully facing chaos that you enter the realm of beauty.

You have to go to the edge to see everything anew.

The artist, the poet, the music composer, the film director, the writer can only design portals into that realm.
These portals are paradoxical things in their own right: ordered and "real" things like a book, a painting, a landscape, a psycho-active chemical, a motion picture, a song, or a poem are literally the doors into new worlds.
You, on top of expressing your own artistic self, must choose to seek the hidden doors and walk through those portals.

On the edge, things are full of their contradicting connotations.
The world moves very very fast by staying firm.
Things can last as long as you want, and the future has full impact on the past.
You are just a decaying flawed mortal, one with the stardust that makes up who you are.

Like Naval Ravikant has put it, *the gate to heaven is sealed with paradox*.
Paradox is the key to heaven because embracing contradictions is the key to living on the edge.
