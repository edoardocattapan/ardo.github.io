Here is a list of online resources I like and consume:

Generic blogs:
- **Wait But Why, by Tim Urban**. I consider this to be an excellent blog for thinking in a critical, analytical, independent and original way about a small range of very different important topics.
On the surface, the original elements are two: the long-form of the posts and the cute stick-figure drawings by the author.
The long-form is because articles go very in-depth into their topics, and usually require months for research and writing.
The drawings are Tim's cool way of making it easier and fun to understand the ideas and help to think through the issues alongside the author.
- **The School Of Life, by Alain de Botton**. I consider this to be the best effort in trying to answer the question "how should I live?", approached from a philosophical and applicable point of view, available to everybody for free on the internet.
- **Mark Manson**
- **James Clear**
- **Barking Up The Wrong Tree**
- **Brain Pickings, by **
- **Aeon**, many of my reasonings can start from reading the articles of Aeon
- **Edge.org**
- **Nautilus**
- **Quanta Magazine**

Analysis on finance and the economy:
