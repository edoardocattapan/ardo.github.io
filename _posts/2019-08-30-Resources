The best resources on the web I frequently read:

Generic blogs:
- **Wait But Why, by Tim Urban**. I consider this to be an excellent blog for thinking in a critical, analytical, independent and original way about a small range of very different important topics.
On the surface, the original elements are two: the extremely long form of the posts, which are published every few months since they require quite some time for research and writing before being published, and the stick-figure drawings by Tim himself, which make the ideas fun and easy to understand.
- **The School Of Life, by Alain de Botton**. I consider this to be the best effort in trying to answer the question "how should I live?", approached from a philosophical and applicable point of view, available to everybody for free on the internet.
