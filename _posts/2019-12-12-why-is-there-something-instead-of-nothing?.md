When you’re being too different, or too far apart from everyone else, you are actually closer than ever to your inescapable social condition, or just to yourself.
Any individual trying to be different than everybody else is actually getting closer to being alike anybody else who is trying as well.

If you move fast enough, approaching the danger zone of the theoretical limits of the speed of light, from your perspective you might actually be closer and closer to not moving at all, relative to everything else.
So fast you don’t move.

If you go further enough to an extreme of any spectrum, if you really push the envelope you might end up on the other side.
In the same way, if you push two things too far apart from each other, at some point they might just merge into sameness.
Opposites might actually just be the same thing.

Paradoxes like these are the walls we hit at the end of infinity.

Infinity is actually so end-less and open a system that its laws and characteristics are not different than as if it was a perfectly closed system.
The extreme open-endedness is such that it comes back to any arbitrarily closed confines.

If you divide any number by 0, you get an *indefinite* result, because arithmetically 0 is nothing.
Indefinite results are beyond the limits of what we grasp, just like the idea of infinity.
Zero and infinity appear to be the same in their indefiniteness.

1/0 means something out of nothing, which is an absurdity by definition.
A fraction means the ratio of the quantity of the numerator over the contextual benchmark of the quantity of the denominator, so 2/3 just means the 66.66% of something.
If you have a pie and divide it in three equal parts (something), you take 2 (something).
The fraction is interpreted as something out of something. But 1/0 is some quantity out of no quantity: something out of nothing.

Creation means something out of nothing.
Creation is illogical.
Creation is actually theoretically impossible.
Still, apparently, there is something instead of nothing.

If something was created out of nothing (the religious argument), then what created the creator and its act of creation?
It’s a simple logical fallacy: a circular reasoning, where we start with what we wanted to end up with as our answer.

Ultimately, a better question is *why*: **why is there something instead of nothing?**

This question is a gateway to the deepest existential conundrum ever.
But if you think simply about it, you can say that the idea of “nothing” is actually something.
In other words, you only have the existential conundrum (or anything at all) in a something-world.

** *Nothing* is really an arbitrary imagination of lack of arbitrariness.**

In this sense, by unveiling where the concept of “nothing” actually comes from, we undermine the legitimacy of the conundrum, suggesting a powerful truth: that *anything* is actually something – and necessarily so.

Still, the question is here in front of us.
