A powerful thing about paradoxes is that they give you a glimpse into a sort of specular absurdity about reality.

When you’re being too different from everyone else, or too far apart from society, you are actually closer than ever to your inescapable social condition, or just to yourself.
Any individual trying to be more different than everybody else is actually getting closer to being alike anybody else who is trying as well.

If you move fast enough, approaching the theoretical limits of the speed of light, from your perspective you might actually be closer and closer to not moving at all, relative to everything else.
So fast you don’t move.

If you go further enough to an extreme of any spectrum, if you really push the envelope you might end up on the other side.
In the same way, if you push two things too far apart from each other, at some point they might just merge into sameness. This is because "too far apart" might mean going to infinity, where the measure for distance begins to lose any relevance.
Opposites might actually just be the same thing.

Paradoxes like these are the walls we hit at the end of infinity.

Infinity is actually so end-less and open a system that its laws and characteristics are not different than as if it was a perfectly closed system.
The extreme open-endedness is such that it comes back to any arbitrarily closed confines.

If you divide any number by 0, you get an *indefinite* result because, arithmetically, 0 means *nothing*.
Indefinite results are beyond the limits of what we grasp well, just like the idea of *infinity*.
By being indefinite, zero and infinity appear to be exactly the same.

1/0 means something out of nothing, which is an absurdity by definition.
A fraction means the ratio of the quantity of the numerator over the contextual benchmark of the quantity of the denominator, so 2/3 just means the 66.66% of something.
If you have a pie and divide it in three equal parts (something), you take 2 (something).
The fraction is interpreted as something out of something. But 1/0 is some quantity out of no quantity: something out of nothing.

1/0 is creation.
Creation is illogical.
Creation is actually theoretically impossible.
Still, in the world we live in, there is *something* instead of nothing.

If this *something* was created out of nothing (the religious argument), then what *something* created the nothing-creator and its nothing-act of creation?
It’s a simple logical fallacy: a circular reasoning, where we start with what we wanted to end up with as our answer.
Even if any clever 5-year-old would be wise enough to discard any religious dogma for this very reason, unfortunately ignorance and clever storytelling have been powerful forces shaping peoples' hopes out of their problems, into religious beliefs.

A better question is *why*: **why is there something instead of nothing?**

This question is a gateway to the deepest existential conundrum.
But if you think simply about it, you can say that the idea of *nothing* is actually something.
***Nothing* is really an arbitrary imagination of lack of arbitrariness.**

Clearly, nothing is actually *something*.
By definition, you can only have an existential conundrum (or anything at all) in a something-world.
In this sense, by unveiling where the concept of nothing *actually* comes from, we can undermine the legitimacy of the conundrum, suggesting a powerful truth: that *anything* is actually something – and necessarily so.

On the other extreme of the existential conundrum spectrum, we can say that something is, actually, nothing.

This might seem hardly true at first, but our current understanding of quantum physics suggests that if an event is not against the laws of quantum physics, then it is guaranteed to happen.
When you quantize space-time (applying quantum laws to the main concept of space-time in general relativity, in an attempt to unify the two fundamental theories in physics) you get an unstable, granular field of fluctuating bubbles of space-time (at the tiny quantum scale) popping in and out of existence by virtue of the inherent "quantum instability" of the nothingness they seem to come from.
In other words: since the act of creation is not forbidden by quantum physics, then the arising of *something out of nothing* was inevitable.

Finally we see the paradox: nothing is something is nothing.

The powerful truth this ultimate specular absurdity might be suggesting is that reality is most interesting at the extremes.

The question of *why* is still right in front of us.
