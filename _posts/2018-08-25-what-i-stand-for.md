Here is a list of personal values that I find are important to me, with a brief explanation of why.

**Independent Thinking**

I believe in the value of thinking for yourself, deploying rationality and logic in a rigorous way.
As Immanuel Kant said: “have the courage to use your own intelligence”.
Thinking is no doubt important: Blaise Pascal believed that thinking is the only way for us humans to “nobilitate” ourselves, as it is what distinguishes humans from other animals in the first place.

But thinking by following the herd is very different from thinking independently by yourself.
In fact, the courage required in choosing to be alone and closer to the truth - instead of being wrong but in good company - is extremely rare, even more rare than genius.
Mark Twain said: “whenever you are part of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect”.

**Human Agency

I believe that people can choose what they think, what they believe, what they do and who they are.
I concede that it is not clear whether we truly enjoy free will, and I believe we only have partial and limited control over our lives.
Still, we do have full control over a few fundamental variables that directly impact our quality of life.
This means that external circumstances such as other people, nature and luck can be taken out of the equation in living life.

I don’t believe in luck as a driving force for the realization of future events, as it is just a conceptual tool for interpreting the unknown reasons which contributed in causing a given event in the past.
Luck makes sense only looking backwards, as an interpretation tool to cover our own partial ignorance of the truth.
Luck does not determine the future: not by any means.


Individual Freedom

I believe that individual freedom is more important than common peace and order.

I feel that the individual dimension is the first place from where to start creating a better society, and not the other way around.
Everything that you ever acknowledge happening (and that which you might fail to see) happens inside yourself, as yourself.

I believe the individual is (as should be) conceptually free from traditional authorities: parents, peer pressure, school, institutions, even law enforcement.
The only real limits that appear to be restricting of individual freedom are the universal laws of physics.


Self-Mastery

I believe the best way to live life is to be self-aware and improve one’s self-knowledge and efficacy over time.
I also believe that, generally, the best way to serve the world is to master yourself first.
Accepting that life is fundamentally hard, you take responsibility for being a good version of who you can be, choosing to be wise and to make the decision to sacrifice something for the sake of doing what's more important.

Deciding to take responsibility, to take care of yourself and to be honest with yourself is the foundation for being able to live in the best way.

In this ongoing process of self-mastery, one key idea I found works wonders for me is to mentally locate my self in a relaxed-accepting-grateful state of mind that is dis-associated in principle from my thoughts and external circumstances.
Even though I find it difficult to maintain this state for more than a few days in a row, I know that third-person view of my reality is my best place to live my life: where I feel my best and I perform my best.

In general, staying mentally "on top" of things (being the bigger person, maintaining perspective, being aware) is very good.

I agree that we should strive for greater collective enlightenment and I think that starts with individual enlightenment.
But once we are enlightened, there is indeed much we should strive to do to continue being our true enlightened selves.
We should strive to be the best version of ourselves, to keep the great values of humanity alive and to expand our questions.


Leading by example

Humans need to be inspired to wake up everyday and live a satisfactory life, driven by positive values and guided by sound principles.
From a top-down perspective, myths, religions and political authorities work very well in uniting people under a common purpose and enable the control of the masses.
But from a bottom-up perspective, these power structures have always represented an easy way for individuals to delegate responsibility for the bigger-picture thinking.
I believe we do not need myths, religions or other conceptual authorities of any kind.
I believe we need examples of fellow human beings who lead by doing things first, showing us what is possible.

In essence, I stand for taking full responsibility for everything in life, not complaining about uncontrollable external factors, independently choosing what to think, knowing yourself and always trying to improve and master yourself, doing the things you are interested about and pursuing your projects with a deterministic and practical approach.
This will make you a better person, the World a better place and inspire everybody around you.
