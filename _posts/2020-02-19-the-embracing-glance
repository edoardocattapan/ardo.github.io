Using your mind power during meditation, you can sense your whole life and appreciate it.
If you pursue further and mold your attention as the embracing glance around the wholeness of your entire existence, you can reframe everything you ever thought, did or felt into your new vivid holy framework of glorious wholeness, eternal unity, connectedness and relationship between all things.

It's like you already know very well that, even when you will be out of this meditation and start to act in the "real world" of 3D physical systems and "real life" limitations, your mind power sustains the conscious perception of connectedness, wholeness and unity across space and time.
You can conceive of your life and the world as just a show - which must go on and on - and you realize that your conscious belief is really a godly power.

The child playing is you.
God is you.
