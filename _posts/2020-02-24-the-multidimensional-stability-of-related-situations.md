When you watch a hand-drawn cartoon by quickly flipping the pages of a book or a post-it, the animation of the cartoon is the sequentiation of a pile of 2D drawings along a third dimension - the thickness of the stack of pages.
Likewise when you go to the theatre, the action is the smooth sequentiation of different situations being acted across time.
This logic is compelling and works with as many dimensions as we like.

Video-games, virtual reality and the "real world" can in fact be put under the same lenses.
From the perspective of the player, a video-game is out-of-time and a virtual environment is out-of-space.
The a-temporality of a video-game and the a-spaciality of a virtual-reality environment are compelling evidence that it is possible for a-spatial-a-temporal realities to exist.

After all: what does *reality* appear to be, but a sequentiality of 3D instantiations along the fourth dimension of duration?

Inside the dimension of duration, time has in theory a very malleable verse and directionality, even though our perception of time seems to be stuck to one irreversible verse along a determined direction, albeit with a very malleable velocity.

What is less malleable is the characterizations of distance in space and duration in time of each instant and situation in the *real world*.

Like when you slice bread it is the depth which gives it a 3-dimensional character, and when you see a movie it is the duration of the sequencing of frames which gives the film action, so when you ponder the *real world* it is the transcending of all situations' specific distances and durations onto further dimensions which gives reality its stable wholeness and unity.

The structure of reality is a multidimensional geometry where interconnected relationships arise within - and out of - a stable wholeness and unity.

The "stability" of such geometry is represented, for example, in the curvature of space-time - so that when you see a ball curving its trajectory, you realize it is actually going in a straight line along a curved space.
Gravity is one of the forces at play to make everything ultimately stable in the wholeness of multiple dimensions.

What is the fundamental reality appears to me as a stable, multidimensional geometry of relationships between all situations ever.
With this revelation, order or chaos is an arbitrary distinction.
