When the cogitating individual mind enters into a conceptual trajectory of conciliation with the universal human spirit and the idea of it, the individual spirit is homeward bound and man can access the empowering, dignifying and nobilitating feeling of being part of his greater causes: Necessity, Nature and the Human Family.

The reconciliation of the universal human spirit into one man's own being instantly enables the individual to naturally be the whole human representation that he is.

Like any ocean-drop, being no different in concept than any other ocean-drop, is by representing it the whole ocean, so any human-being, being conceptually equal to any other human-being, is and represents the whole of humanity.
Indeed, it is not the water of the drop that is the water of the ocean, as it is not the body of the man that is the body of humanity.
Physical boundaries are not relevant to spirituality.

Any whole is divisible into arbitrary parts, and the reconciliation of the general into the specific happens when the spirit of any one specific part figuratively or consciously *enlightens*, *rises up* and *expands* to illuminate the other parts of the whole, which becomes renovated in spirit because of the spirtual reconciliation.

Reconcile with what you feel is the whole.
Go through the hour knowing that all you know is arbitrary. Go through the hour knowing that you are not you, because who is you?

If you feel like being an individual part of a bigger whole, reconcile.
