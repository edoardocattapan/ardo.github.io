Man has always wanted to search for something beyond himself, beyond his time and beyond what he can experience through the senses.
The search for a truer truth has activated the passion to look deeper in the geology of earth, to look further back in time and study evolutionary biology, to look deeper inwardly and live more spiritually, to build electronic minds and try to understand the mistery that way.

That truer truth is generally accepted to be directionally into the frequencies of unconditional love, peace of mind, deep silence, timelessness and selflessness.

But once you recognize it, you miss it.

He who knows he loves does not know love, because love is selfless.
He who knows he is silent does not know silence, because silence is selfless.
He who knows he is real does not know reality, because reality is selfless.
He who knows he is aware does not know awereness, because awereness is selfless.

No mind, no self, no being can deny itself as its way into timelessness and selflessness.

At the extreme:
The dead is silent, as he does not know he is.
The dead is real, as he does not know he is.
The dead is aware, as he does not know he is.

The paradox of reality is too strong for the mind to grasp or bear, thus we struggle in our life-search walking near the edge of the paradox, staring all along into the abiss - only to finally fall and achieve the sacred truth.
