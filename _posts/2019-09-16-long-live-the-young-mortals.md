Let's start with the sad truth.
The average human lifespan in first-world countries was considerably shorter just a few decades ago, caused by worse quality of life, health conditions and overall wellbeing than today.
Inevitably, even longer-lived humans must die eventually, as we approach - slowly but surely - an old age of physical weakness and solitude, only to face - helpless - our mortality.

Clearly, we have some things we should try to change - a part from our individual perception and personal interpretation of these problems.

Death, ageing and a short life-span are up to us to be confronted with, but not all evils come to harm.

We should choose carefully which enemies to fight, keeping in mind that our most precious finite resource is time:

- Beat short longevity and you've made your most precious resource more abundant;

- Beat ageing and you've made your most precious resource more enjoyable;

- Beat death and you've made your most precious resource worthless.

Now the choice should be easy: staying younger and living longer are just more convenient options than the one we cannot afford.

Arguably, death is good for the species because it ensures regeneration as the necessary condition for the innovation of the species.
On the contrary, a short life-span is bad - mostly for you and your loved ones - as you have little time to enjoy the ride.
Finally, ageing is bad for all, because it only brings about slow and painful biological processes on your body and mind, with a negative impact on your loved ones and the broader community in many different ways: psychological, financial and physical above all.

Trying to achieve immortality seems like an excruciating fight against the forces of nature, but achieving any marginal improvement on the longevity and ageing fronts - to lengthen our lifespans and avoid getting old - is within our reach.

With a longer lifespan you would continue working and spend more time with your loved ones.
Living to 150 years old - and not just 90 - you have more chances to learn new things, grow as a person, share your gifts and help raise better children: you can create more good things, for yourself and for others.

People like to say you should live everyday as if it were your last, because death is getting closer.
But the day you live as if it were your last could instead be the day when death is far away, when you could live as if you truly had more time on your hands and you could choose, once again, to fight against the dying of the light.
