Has this precise moment been coming from the future all along?
In what coherent sense is anything that happens being perceived as real in the face of time flowing?

The stoics believed that *fata viam invenient*, or "**fate finds the way**".
The phrase epitomises the comfort of fatalism without bringing along all its demotivating effects of inaction.
The enticing allure of a destiny being already set in stone comes in strong forms, but it somehow has to deal with our present power to choose our way.

To say that *fate finds the way* is not to say that the future is already written or that it is just a matter of letting the timer of the present steadily slide forward and things will be as they were always meant to be anyway.

*Fate finds the way* means that things (actions, events) have consequences, and that those consequences are surely set to come.
Do what you want and you will be rewarded with your consequences, set to come in their ways.
What those consequences are depends on both the **choices** one makes and the **necessities** one is faced with.

As well as to the power of destiny, the phrase really speaks to the power of choosing and accepting what is necessary.
Under this light, a tautology like "*what will be will be*" is even more true, because the (a-posteriori) inevitability of what has been coming all the way from our destiny converges with our future-leaning sense of choice and authorship, in this moment.

If anything is set in stone, you hold the chisel.

In practice, one should assume a stoic sense of responsibility to choose to do the right thing. This means **to act upon what is within one's power and to accept what is without**. The consequences of *these* choices set the new realities of future situations.
