Creation is the process by which something comes into existence from a place of non-existence.
In the same fashion, annihilation is the process by which something goes out of existence into a place of non-existence.

When we accept creation and annihilation - birth and death - in our conception of the world, we easily come to connect the dots and paint the picture of "*becoming-in-time*".
That is to say: the process by which *something* (something like *you*, the reader) is non-existent, then it is born (coming into existence), lives (exists), and then dies (goes into non-existence).
The process of *becoming-in-time* strictly implies an irreversible flow of time.

Creation, annihilation and the process of "becoming-in-time" are all, then, very tightly interrelated and necessary for each other to legitimize the concept for the flow of time.

**Creation and annihilation are impossible because what exists is a-temporal.**

What exists has no nihilistic tendency of "becoming" nothing, which would concur into legitimizing the flow of time.
What does-not-exist has no tendencies to a supposedly inherent power of creation, which would change nothing into something.

Of that which does not exist, actually, there exist no properties to attach to, nor actions to attribute to.
Talking about what does exist, there is a stark truth to be acknowledged: there is no possibility (or need) for change.

There is no possibility (or need) for things to *become" something other than which they are.
There is no possibility (or need) for things to shift from their status and transform into something else.
There is no need for things to move across space.
There is no need for things to move across time.

There is movement in the form of the particular shifting perceptions of consciousness.
So *living* is real, but everything is itself and not changing into other things.

If you think you see change, you can only do so by first - arbitrarily - creating the unfounded assumptions of the flow of time, where creation, annihilation and "becoming-in-time" also are necessary, in a world view where separate, indepentent parts of the whole are acting inside an environment which is itself an independent part of reality.

Separation is not real.
What is real is only this exact moment, where everything exists.
From the individual's perspective, consciousness is simultaneously the "creator" and the "witness" of what is real.
Light exists only as your eyes are open or your skin senses the heat.

**You author and play what is real, at the same moment.**

I'll end here with something actually real: **everything is here, eternal, glorious** - you and me included.
