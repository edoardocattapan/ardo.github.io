 Here is a list of personal values that I find are important to me, with a brief explanation of why.
 
 Independent Thinking
  
 I believe in the value of thinking for yourself.
 As Immanuel Kant said, "Have the courage to use your own intelligence".
 Thinking is no doubt important: Blaise Pascal believed that thinking is the only way for us humans to "nobilitate" ourselves.
 It is what distinguishes humans from other animals in the first place.
 
 But thinking by following the herd is very different from thinking independently by yourself.
 In fact, the courage required in choosing to be alone and closer to the truth - instead of being wrong but in good company - is extremely rare, even more rare than genius.
 As Mark Twain said "whenever you are part of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect".
  
 Human Agency
 
 I believe that people can choose what they think, what they believe, what they do and who they are.
 This means that external circumstances such as other people, nature and luck can be taken out of the equation.
 
 I don't believe in luck as a driving force for the realization of future events, but just as a tool for interpreting the unkown reasons that caused any given event in the past.
 Luck makes sense only looking backwards, as an interpretation tool to cover our own ignorance of the truth. Luck does not determine the future, not by any means.
 
 Self-Mastery
 
 I believe the best way to live life is to be self-aware and improve one's self-knowledge and self-efficacy to achieve self-actualization.
 The best way to help the world is to master yourself.
 
 Liberalism
 
 I believe in individual freedom from traditional authorities.
 I believe that individual freedom is more important than common peace and order. I feel that the individual dimension is the first place from where to start creating a better society, and not the other way around.
 
 Leading by example
 
 Humans need to be inspired to wake up everyday and live a satisfactory life, driven by positive values and guided by sound principles.
 From a top-down perspective, myths, religions and political authorities work very well in uniting people under a common purpose and enable the control of the masses.
 But from a bottom-up perspective, these power structures have always represented an easy way for individuals to delegate responsibility for the bigger-picture thinking.
 I believe we do not need myths, religions or other conceptual authorities of any kind.
 I believe we need examples of fellow human beings who lead by doing things, showing us what is possible.
 
 The bottom line is: take 100% responsibility for everything in your life, don't complain about uncontrollable external factors, independently choose what to think, know yourself and always try to improve yourself, do the things you are interested about and pursue your projects with a deterministic and practical approach. This will make the World a better place and inspire everybody else.
