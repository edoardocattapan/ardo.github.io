 Independent Thinking
 
 I believe in the value of thinking for yourself.
 As Immanuel Kant said, "Have the courage to use your own intelligence".
 Blaise Pascal believed that thinking is the only way for us humans to "nobilitate" ourselves.
 Thinking is what distinguished humans from all animals in the first place.
 But thinking by following the herd is very different from thinking independently by yourself.
 In fact, the courage required in choosing to be alone and closer to the truth - instead of being wrong but in good company - is extremely rare, even more rare than genius.
 As Mark Twain said "whenever you are part of the majority, it is time to pause and think".
  
 Human Agency
 
 I believe that people can choose what they think, what they believe, what they do and who they are.
 This means that your outcomes in life have to do with you. External circumstances such as other people, nature and luck can be taken out of the equation.
 I don't believe in luck as a driving force for the realization of future events, but just as a tool for interpreting the unkown reasons that caused any given event in the past.
 Luck makes sense only looking backwards, as an interpretation tool to cover our own ignorance of the truth. Luck does not determine the future, not by any means.
 
 Liberalism
 
 I believe in freedom from traditional authorities.
 
 Leading by example
 
 Humans need to be inspired to wake up everyday and live a satisfactory life, driven by positive values and guided by sound principles.
 From a top-down perspective, myths, religions and political authorities work very well in uniting people under a common purpose and enable the control of the masses.
 But from a bottom-up perspective, these power structures have always represented an easy way for individuals to delegate responsibility for the bigger-picture thinking.
 I believe we do not need myths, religions or other conceptual authorities of any kind.
 I believe we need examples of fellow human beings who lead by doing things and, as a byproduct, they show us what is possible.
 
 What this means:
 
 So take 100% responsibility for everything in your life, don't complain about uncontrollable external factors, independently choose what to think and do.
