Honesty, Courage, Kindness.

My worldview reduced to its fundamental foundations, the values one finds are a triad of virtues: honesty, courage and kindness.

Courage could be the why, kindness the how, the truth the what.
Always telling the truth with kind, compassionate, warm regards towards people and things because one bravely fights his fears. 

Courage is the WHY because it is all ultimately about fighting your fears, taking risks, carrying the burden of suffering with dignity.
With courage you take risks: if you fail you learn something and gain suffering and wisdom, if you succeed you gain happiness and fulfillment.
