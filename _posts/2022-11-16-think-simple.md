Most people don't think simple enough.

There is a lot of confusion about being human, about how to live, what choices to make, what to accept and what to oppose, who to love,
where to follow through and where to give up, how to be creative, how to be happy, how to be sad, how to be true to one's self, how to be honest, how to be kind, how to have courage.
A lot of confusion whenever there is doubt and whenever there is hope.
Intellectual and emotional complexities driven by running scenarios of more or less optimism and pessimism around probable outcomes.
Meta-things distract from things.
A lot of coulours, shades, lights, juxtapositions, framings.
A lot of fear.
This confusion arises when too much intelligence and emotion are at play.
This confusion causes various forms of psychological suffering.

Take a breath. Think simple.

Think binary also.
Things at some fundamental level might just be either black or white.
If you look close enough, every shade of grey is a just peculiar combination of black and white "pixels".
Every shade of grey - every complexity - is an optical illusion of holistic perception.
There does not need to be confusion, when complexity is debunked into simplicity.

Think of what you want to do.
Choose how deep to ponder the question of why.
Do it.

Fuck optimism and pessimism, fuck doubt, fuck hope, fuck that complex confusion.

Just do it.

If it's a complicated thing that you want to do, make it simple.
Ask what does the ideal result look like, and what are the few most fundamental parts needed and sufficient to make it.
Find a way or make a way to do it.

Bye.
