Most people don't think simple enough.

There is a lot of confusion about being human, about how to live, what choices to make, what to accept and what to oppose, who to love,
where to follow through and where to give up, how to be creative, how to be happy, how to be sad, how to be true to one's self, how to be honest, how to be kind, how to have courage.
A lot of confusion whenever there is doubt and whenever there is hope.
Intellectual and emotional complexities driven by running scenarios of more or less optimism and pessimism around probable outcomes.
A lot of coulours, shades, lights, juxtapositions, framings.
A lot of fear.
This confusion arises when too much intelligence and emotion are at play.
This confusion causes various forms of psychological suffering.

Take a breath. Think simple.

Think binary.
Things are black or white.
Every shade of grey is a peculiar combination of black and white pixels.
Every shade of grey is an optical illusion of holistic perception.

Think of what you want to do.
Do it.

Fuck optimism and pessimism, fuck doubt, fuck hope, fuck that confusion.

Just do it.

If it's a complicated thing that you want to do, make it simple.
Ask what does the ideal risult look like, and what are the few most fundamental parts needed and sufficient to make it.
Find a way or make a way to do it.

Bye.
