Where do our political inclinations come from?
There is a theory from psychology that our political inclinations come from our relationship with our own father, because he is the first authority figure we are confronted with, thus giving shape to our own sensibility for setting the balance between chaos and order.
In politics, chaos is freedom and order is authority.

As with most things that map along a spectrum, extremes in politics are a sign of a poor balance in the mind: excessively skewed towards either chaos (too much freedom is anarchy) or order (too much authority is totalitarianism).

For me, I value individual freedom.
I stand for freedom and liberty, free expression of the individual, and simpathize for liberalism, liberism and libertarianism; but in order to avoid anarchy, I choose to regard conservatism's sane and ordered frame of mind as a necessary ingredient for thinking about how to live well in society.
In fact, as conservatives know, the first and necessary condition for enjoying freedom is to contain it.
Histroy has shown us too many times that people can only enjoy freedom when it is regulated and its extreme expressions are avoided.

In addition to finding a balanced position along the chaos-order spectrum in my own mind, I have two key arguments to make when I think about where I stand and what I believe in politics.

In any field, I endorse people who engage in independent critical thinking and take decisive resolute actions with integrity.

Critical thinking, resolution and integrity: with these guiding principles I find it smoother to coherently discern the good from the bad, or the strong from the weak, in politics.

Critical thinking is the opposite of dogma: I strongly believe everything should be up for discussion.
Being able to critically rediscuss and change the Constitution, national borders, international treaties, immigration policy, economic or fiscal policies: this is good.
Holding on to some time-tested values such as "family", "religion", "nation" or "God" and to avoid any critical thinking around them: this is bad.

When choosing a political party to vote, I take into consideration the proposed political program as much as the character of the leader.
I consider decisive characters to be the ideal political leaders: charismatic individuals who are not afraid to take resolute action, at all given times.
I want a competent and resolute leader who will, with the highest integrity, both say what they do and do what they say.
This means I will only support a leader who has a clear and strong vision for the future: integrity and resolution are the only way that being a good political leader can even make sense.
I do support such leaders, when I see them.
They are rare in politics, because true strength and integrity are rare traits in any individual.

So, exluding the extremes of both left-wing and right-wing politics, I look at contemporary moderate views.
Although I appreciate the positive attitude towards social reform and justice of the progressive left, I disagree with the socialist foundation of their political views, because I do not believe that rights are more important than duties, nor that equality of social condition is necessarily a good thing, especially if it is based on the false assumptions that merit and talent are equally (not normally) distributed across society, that people are all fundamentally very similar, and that people should strive for continued equality through their fundamental right to ask the government for it.
This whole socialist view of society is deeply flawed and it does not value the individual person as much as I believe should be done.

I am liberal and, at the same time, conservative for different reasons: liberal because liberals marry critical thinking more than dogmas when caring about individual freedom, and conservative because individual freedom needs to be contained in order to be enjoyed by all individuals living together as a society.

I tend to agree with a socially liberal and fiscally conservative view of politics:
- individuals are free in thought, expression, enterprise, and free to choose on all ethical issues such as abortion or euthanasia (terminally ill people should be seen as individuals worthy of exceptional empathy, rather than people to be managed by a law);
- private companies and associations are free, sectors of the economy are privatized and selectively deregulated;
- government is minimized to excel at a few crucial services: public goods, legislation and justice, social security and defense;
- taxes are low, public debt is minimized and military spending is contained to reduce public debt;
- government spending is low: more focused and efficient on delivering public goods, ensuring equality of opportunity and justice, and investing in the best private research facilities for science, healthcare, education and innovation;
- foreign policy is non-interventionist: working through international treaties, trade and diplomacy, with the exception of restrictive and selective interventions for defense purposes;
- illegal immigration is avoided, as it threatens a nation's sentiments for safety, continuity of culture and is inconsistent with a sovereign nation's values and definition.

There is also a question of which is the best form of government to organize a society around, and clearly history shows us that the achievement of representative democracy in the Western world is rather important, as much as it is fragile.
Having thought about this, I maintain that the idea of "adoptive aristocracy" has very good merits: that is, the governor-in-chief (be it an emperor, a president or a prime minister) should be able to appoint his own successor, chosen from a highly-competitive hierarchy of individuals who have consistently demonstrated qualities of integrity, courage, leadership, intelligence, honesty, and are highly competent and knowledgeable in the subjects of economy, law, international relations, geopolitics, local politics, ethics, psychology and so on. Once appointed, the new governor-elect should clearly set a practical vision of how he wants his nation to change under his leadership, only to be put under democratic veto: a democratic referendum to approve or reject his mandate.
This way, the outcome of a competent leader is prioritized and the people retain the highest veto, while the negative aspects of populistic electoral campaigns and of corrupt oligarchies are contained. Of course there are drawbacks to this system too, but in some countries it might be a real valid alternative to try out.
