Where do our political inclinations come from?

Some psychologists believe that our political inclinations come from our relationship with our own father, because he is the first authority figure who helps to mold our own sensibility for setting the right balance between chaos and order in our lives.
In politics, chaos is freedom and order is authority.

As with most things that map along a spectrum, extremes in politics are a sign of a poor balance in the mind: excessively skewed towards either chaos (too much freedom is anarchy) or order (too much authority is totalitarianism).

For me, **I value individual freedom.**
I stand for freedom and liberty, free expression of the individual, and simpathize for liberalism, liberism and libertarianism; but in order to avoid anarchy, I choose to regard conservatism's sane and ordered frame of mind as a necessary ingredient for thinking about how to live well in society.
In fact, as conservatives know, the first and necessary condition for enjoying freedom is to contain it.
Histroy has shown us too many times that people can only enjoy freedom when it is regulated and its extreme expressions are avoided.

In addition to finding a balanced position along the chaos-order spectrum in my own mind, I have two key arguments to make when I think about where I stand and what I believe in politics.

In any field, **I endorse people who engage in independent critical thinking and take decisive resolute actions with integrity.**

Critical thinking, resolution and integrity: with these guiding principles I find it smoother to coherently discern the good from the bad, or the strong from the weak, in politics.

Critical thinking is the opposite of dogma: I strongly believe everything should be up for discussion.
Being able to critically rediscuss and change the Constitution, national borders, international treaties, immigration policy, economic or fiscal policies: this is good.
Holding on to some time-tested values such as "family", "religion", "nation" or "God" and to avoid any critical thinking around them: this is bad.

When choosing a political party to vote, I take into consideration the proposed political program as much as the character of the leader.
I consider decisive characters to be the ideal political leaders: charismatic individuals who are not afraid to take resolute action, at all given times.
I want a competent and resolute leader who will, with the highest integrity, both say what they do and do what they say.
This means I will only support a leader who has a clear and strong vision for the future: integrity and resolution are the only way that being a good political leader can even make sense.

I do support such leaders, when I see them.
They are rare in politics, because true strength and integrity are rare traits in any individual.
