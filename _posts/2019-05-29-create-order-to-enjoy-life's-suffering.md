Floating in a universe of chaotic information, we are here to create and expand pockets of order: new patterns of information, structures of atoms and ideas. However small, local, temporary or illusory, these "pockets of order" are what we are here to do in order for us to bear the necessity of life's condition of suffering.
Ultimately, by creating our pockets of order, we come to find beauty and meaning in the necessity of our existence, which is permeated by suffering.

Suppose that from the moment you were born, you lived your life in a passive mode, reacting to events and external impositions, and never showed any intention, any commitment or any active involvement in anything.
This life of yours would certainly be full of psychological suffering, as you would question its meaning and would struggle to find a strong enough reason for you to continue to be alive, that is to continue being a passive victim of life and experience all sorts of sufferings.

The opposite direction to living your life is clearly the way to go.
The reason you should live in an active mode, and choose to do something instead of nothing, is to show courage and intentionally choose to create harmonious structures of order for you and other people to experience, in order for you to better cope with all of life's necessary sufferings, and even to grow common knowledge and ultimately enjoy life.

Given that we all suffer, we fundamentally want to spend our time alive dealing with the problem of suffering, be it psychological or physical, imposed either by circumstance or self-imposed.

One way we deal with the problem of suffering is through momentarily forgetting about it by thinking about something good.
A more radical way we avoid psychological suffering is by taking substances such as drugs, alcohol and sugar, or by indulging in very short-term pleasurable activities.

Another way we deal with our suffering is by artificially creating "altars" of values in the name of which we can bear living through all our sufferings. These "altars" of values are ordered structures of ideas at the theoretical foundations of religious beliefs: be it our own spirit, or the idea of divine entities, the unfathomable nature of the Universe, or the process of life itself.

There is another way we deal with the problem of suffering: by noticing unexpected pockets of harmonious order in our conscious experience.
This is the beauty of nature and art: music, sculptures, paintings, cinema, photography, poetry, stories.
Other than nature, all the art forms are artificially created by people (artists), but other people experience them as unexpected pockets of harmonious order.

Finally, there is the "flow experience": a fine balance of artificially-created and unexpected moments when we experience a very rich, harmonious order of information and feel an effortless and deeply fulfilling enjoyment in performing an activity for its own sake.

In a broader sense, and most effectively for our everyday experience of life, the way to endure suffering is outlined by the foundational principles of stoic philosophy for living through life: facing suffering, accepting it, taking responsibility for it, bearing all sufferings with nobility, self-respect, self-reliance, dignity, and to care for each other by being present and helping bear the suffering for other people in all possible ways, leading by example.
We must withstand all hardships with a deep sense of resilience, as difficulties are not only a major part of life, but underlie at the very logic of the game we play by being alive.

**The purpose of life, then, is to be an artist: to create pockets of harmonious order for other people to enjoy.**

**And life itself is the opportunity to make our greatest work of art: its meaning is to show how we choose to bear the necessary suffering.**

These "pockets of harmonious order", for you to appreciate, to create, sustain and promote, are to be found everywhere: in nature, in music, in dance, in literature, in poetry, in all art-forms (paintings, sculptures, photography, film, theatre), in sports, in family and community organization, in architecture, in all branches of knowledge, in scientific research and - perhaps ultimately - in philosophical enquiry.
