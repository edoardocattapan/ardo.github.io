Suppose that from the moment you were born, you lived your life in a passive mode, reacting to events and orders from other people, and never showed any intention, any commitment or any active involvement in anything.
This life of yours would certainly be full of psychological suffering, as you would question the meaning of it and struggle to find one that is meaningful enough for you to continue to be alive, being a passive victim of all sorts of sufferings.

The opposite approach to living life is clearly the way to go.
The reason you should live in an active mode, and choose to do something in the first place, is to intentionally create harmonious structures of order for you and other people to better deal with and endure all of life's necessary sufferings, and even to grow common knowledge and ultimately enjoy life.

Floating in a universe of chaotic information, we are here to create and expand pockets of order: new patterns of information, structures of atoms and ideas. However small, local, temporary or illusory, these "pockets of order" are what we are here to do in order for us to bear the necessity of life's condition of suffering.
Ultimately, by creating our pockets of order, we come to find beauty and meaning in the necessity of our existence, which is permeated by suffering.

Given that we all suffer, we fundamentally want to spend our time alive dealing with the problem of suffering, be it psychological or physical, imposed either by circumstance or self-imposed.

One way we deal with the problem of suffering is through momentarily forgetting about it by thinking about something good.
A more radical way we avoid psychological suffering is by taking substances such as drugs, alcohol and sugar, or by indulging in very short-term pleasurable activities.

Another way we deal with our suffering is by artificially creating "altars" of values in the name of which we can bear living through all the sufferings.
This is what the idea of God serves for, be it an idolized divine entity, life itself, nature or ourselves.

There is another way we deal with the problem of suffering: by noticing unexpected pockets of harmonious order in our experience.
This is the beauty of nature and art: music, sculptures, paintings, cinema, photography, poetry, stories.
Other than nature, all the art forms are artificially created by people (artists), but other people experience them as unexpected pockets of harmonious order.

Finally, there is the "flow experience": a combination of self-created and unexpected moments when we experience a rich harmonious order of information and an effortless, self-fulfilling enjoyment in performing an activity.

The way to endure suffering is outlined by the typical stoic principles of living through life.
This is the best way to live: facing suffering, accepting it, taking responsibility for it, bearing all sufferings with nobility, self-respect, self-reliance, dignity, and to care for each other by being present and helping bear the suffering for other people in all possible ways, leading by example. We must withstand all hardships with a deep sense of resilience, as difficulties are not only part of life, but the very game we play.

The purpose of life, then, is to be an artist: to create pockets of harmonious order for other people to enjoy.
And life itself is the opportunity to make our greatest work of art: its meaning is to show how we choose to bear the necessary suffering.

These "pockets of harmonious order", for you to appreciate and to create, are to be found everywhere: in nature, in music, in dance, in literature, in poetry, in all art-forms (paintings, sculptures, photography, film, theatre), in sports, in family and community organization, in architecture, in all branches of knowledge, in scientific research, in philosophical enquiry.
