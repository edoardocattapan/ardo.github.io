For all we know, our life is the only shot we have at playing in a rich environment, with no intrinsic meaning, and an extrinsic significance which can be attached to it at will.
The stage where we are playing now is a rich, live environment of energy and information, doing its thing and getting (c)older towards a state of enthropic death, or cold nothingness.
As part of this universal cooling process, we have the chance to play our small part in the exchange of information and energy; but if we are to be honest, we should keep in mind that - eventually - everything we do or witness is all tending to nothing.

We just build "castles in the air": many small ordered structures of information/energy/people/money (like companies, nations with rules, organizations with stakeholders) and it's everything inscribed in this temporary reality which is the living universe we live in.
All our activities - including our very existence - are an attempt to deny our own death as individuals and to impossibly fight against universal enthropy.
We don't just sit down and wait for the cold, dark end which is awaiting us.
We instead create works of art which would endure through time and against our own death.
In the words of poet Dylan Thomas, we "do not go gentle into that good night [but] rage, rage against the dying of the light".

In all honesty though, we know that eventually everything we build is going to fall apart.
This might seem depressing, but it's instead an attempt at acknowledging our finite and meaningless nature.
Once acknowledged and understood, this condition can empower us to play our role with that much more consciousness as to do our thing as best as we can do it. For ourselves.

We're here to play music, to create art, to dance, to express ourselves and stay close together under the infinite sky.

In this sense, a group of people dancing on the beach under the moonlight would definitely express a truer life purpose than that implied by people sitting in an arena to argue over politics and the causes of past events.

If human life is ultimately about maximising the good feelings for the mind (such as love, happiness, entertainement, fun, joy, gratitude, forgiveness, mindfulness etc.), we are here to be aware of how good the processing of information "feels" in our brains.
This "good feeling of information" is our consciousness: machines process information but cannot feel the processing of information.
In fact, machines are helping us by enriching our reality with more engaging information: playing video games actually is not a waste of time, but maybe the only truly meaningful thing we can do here, for our minds will get even more engaged than in the reality we are used to.

In aggregate then, we are here to acknowledge and expand our collective consciousness, and that seems to be the purpose of humanity: to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness.

By the way, this is also why it's a great idea not to take yourself or anything too seriously and why it's important to have a good sense of humor.
