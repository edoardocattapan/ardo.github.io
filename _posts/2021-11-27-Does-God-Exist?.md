Let's start by saying that we don't really know.

Do you believe in God?
This is a better question because it acknowledges that God's existence is much less a logical or objective truth, and much more a spiritual and subjective conscious experience.

There seems to be an infinite richness, beauty, validity, importance and meaning to illogical thoughts.
Things like imagination, fear, dreams, belief and love are not necessarily strictly logical or rational.

If doubt is the most extreme version of critical rationality, faith is the opposite.
We say that you "fall in love", or that you "take a leap of faith": the very acts of falling or taking a leap into the unkown are fundamentally irrational and absolutely risky things to do.

God's existence is not necessarily just a matter of objective reason: it is a matter of subjective conscious experience.
Like love, faith is limitlessly powerful and it is irrational: there lies its power.

Faith in God means faith in all that is grander and uncontrollable by the subjective experiencer: nature, time, life, destiny.
From this subjective experiencer's point of view - which is necessarily the only true point of view for me -, a belief in an idea can be so powerful that it becomes faith in the idea: the unquestionable trust in something grander and uncontrollable.
This trust in the unknown, this faith, can grow stronger overtime - by being continuously confirmed and reinforced by ascribing everything that is perceived as outside one's control as a direct or indirect function of God - and gradually (or suddenly) solidify what is perceived as - and therefore is - knowledge of truth.

This approach to one's worldview and subjective conscious experience shapes one's mind and actions, dignifies the significance of one's beliefs and actions in a World where things outside one's control have a major, continuous, persistent impact on one's life - and ultimately gives meaning to life.

So, are you the person who holds onto logic and reason to attempt to explain something objectively, or are you the person who surrenders to the reality of irrational and uncontrollable forces shaping all things, thus *choosing to see* the unkown, to accept it and to inscribe everything into it?

In one's course of life, we usually start with believing in magic, in the mysterious forces of the world, in an invisible sense of wonder, curiosity and awe towards the world, as children.
Most people, growing up, then tend to rationalize their way out of religious dogma and tend to see a weak thesis around the spiritual dimension in their life, although some still like to cling on it as their mind and spirit are more drawn to it by helping to feel complete and purposeful.
But even the non-religious and non-spiritual people, in the rare and most profound moments of their existence - ie. when faced with the loss of a loved one, a tragedy or in a contemplating moment in their final days - will wonder if, in fact, God was there all along the way.

Whether it is the few really great scientists, artists or sportsmen, *the great human lives are generally lead by individuals who believe in God with strong faith*.
For example: Albert Einstein, Muhammad Ali, Ayrton Senna.
For these individuals and many like them, there is no need of a concrete proof of God's existence, because God's existence is the very sense of their existence.
God, in other words, is necessarily to be **experienced**, and not to be investigated.

The reason for this I think is deep, abstract and simple: *the individual will to live life is as strong as the faith in a greater power to realize that life*.
The will equals the faith. Controllables and uncontrollables mesh together.
Forward and backward tendencies in time converge into making what is now present.

In life, things are done by you, but also to you: therefore all things end up happening through you, and ultimately as you.

**The coming of fate conduces to see why God exists.**

To hope, believe, have faith and know that fate is here: this takes perspective.
Fate coming, destiny being unrolled under the present, the self actualizing, reality unfolding, things being consciously alive seemingly and evidently manifest a deeper, grander truth.
What that truth is is God.

The grander the scheme of ideas, the weaker the words are to grasp it, the more meaningful the idea.

Like in John Conway's *Game of Life*, a conscious mind is a pattern-perceiving, pattern-seeking combination of matter, energy, information.
A mind is an emergent pattern-seeking pattern, among a playingfield that is mostly made up of and populated by non-pattern-seeking patterns.
So all the mind seeks to be doing is to make all things so that there is tension in the world towards a totalistic answer that is God, giving retrospective meaning to the mind's inherent activity.

We are seeking answers to our questions, so there would better be a totalistic answer to our ultimate questions for our own existence to even mean anything at all.

Whereas the Christian God is personified and thought to be transcending of spacetime and into human affairs, Spinoza's God is immanent in all things as all-things is what God is.

God's presence is literally evident in front of me and I could find it in all things: it is not a person who could phyisically transcend spacetime to create it, oversee it, judge it or intervene on it.

God is, therefore God exists.

In fact, God being here, we are it.
