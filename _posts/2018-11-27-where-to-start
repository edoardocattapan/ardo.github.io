It makes sense to start building a life based on the most solid evidence and timeless truths of life.
It makes sense to start from the highest values of humanity: unity, peace, freedom, dignity, education, ambition.

It makes sense to start from those high values and declinate a few simple and minimal logics, or principles for life: keeping things simple and positive, loving what you have, what you do, who you are and who you encounter along the way.
Gratitude and forgiveness bring the possibility of a true practice of love in everyday life.

Maintaining a scientific rational approach when approaching new problems, as science really is the most effective philosophy: among all methods of thought, it is the most solid and universal.
This means making unbiased observations and making hypotheses to test in the real world: from the most solid premises, one can make new conclusions that are relevant in many ways.

You have to be self-aware to know your basic traits that don't seem to change, monitor your behaviours and beliefs over time to define your strengths and weaknesses.
For example, I am very good at being self-aware and analytical, and I am pretty bad at mental calculus.
I am fundamentally introverted but I can be very successful in social life.
I am pretty good at achieving and maintaining an internal balance between focusing and performing very effective thinking activities and maintaining a clear mental dissociation from my thoughts.
I am a living contradiction. I live in the extremes.

I agree that we should strive for a greater collective enlightenment, and that starts with individual enlightenment.
But once we are enlightened, there is indeed much we should strive to do to keep being our true selves.
We should strive to be the best version of ourselves, keep on the great values of humanity and expand our questions.
