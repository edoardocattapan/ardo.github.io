When the cogitating individual mind enters into a conceptual trajectory of conciliation with the universal human spirit and its idea, the individual spirit is homeward bound and man can access the empowering, dignifying and nobilitating feeling of being part of his greater causes: Necessity, Nature and the Human Family.

The reconciliation of the universal human spirit into one man's own being instantly enables the individual to naturally be the whole human representation that he is.

Like any arbitrary ocean-drop, being no different in concept than any other ocean-drop, is and represents the whole ocean, so any arbitrary human-being, being no different in concept than any other human-being, is and represents the whole of humanity.
It is not the water of the drop that is the water of the ocean, and it is not the body of the man that is the body of humanity.
Any whole is divisible into arbitrary parts, and the reconciliation of the general into the specific happens when the spirit of any one specific part figuratively or consciously *enlightens*, *rises* and *expands* to illuminate any other parts of the whole, which is now renovated in spirit because of this individual spirtual enlightenment.
