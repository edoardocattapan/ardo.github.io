The individual should help advance a good cause he and his people mutually believe in.
Because the individual dies but Life does not die with him.
So the contribution to Life (be it conscious or not, human or not, "civilized" or not) - the individual being a small part of it - is to be a good part of it.
And to do so silently and humbly - knowing that individual pride and entitlement are really misallocations of merit.

The meaning of one's life is that is is lived with meaning.
Whatever topic the meaning is revolving around, all that is really essential is that the conscious experience is ordered in a way that, at any moment and at any rate, non-controllable things are accepted and employed, while controllable information and resources are consciously chosen and allocated, to the achievement of one's chosen goals and mission of advancing a cause.
