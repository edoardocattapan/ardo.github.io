Life is difficult because you live two lives in the same streak of being alive.

One life is your personal story as an individual: your name, your personality, your interests and ambitions.
This life is about independence, personal control and free will.

The other life is your being a member of humanity, a member of civilization, a ring inside the chain of human generations, a result of your parents as a possible means to new members of humanity, an anonimous piece for the continuation of the specie.
This life is about total dependece, and (in)voluntary surrender to bigger forces, for nature's necessities.

While the two motives for existence find their intersection right along your life story-line, the discrepancies between the two are remarkable at a fundamental level.
These radical differences of narrative, in both means and ends for being alive, can sometimes make life difficult for you.

For example, a genetical drawback being evident in your physicality or even personality may hinder your possibilities at winning the game of natural selection controlled by the opposite sex (nature is most of all that which selects), even when building a family was one of your main goals in life.
Or perhaps you have other hidden hereditary qualities that would otherwise have been a treasured heritage for the continuation of the specie, which will never be passed on.
In this case, your personal life story and your specie's life story through you are showing opposite goals to be achieved by you.
Of course in some cases it is possible that, to an extent, your personal goals can override your specie's goals as expressed through your life, when you decide to artificially inseminate or otherwise use condoms, for example.
In this case, the discrepancy manifests no particular malevolence nor incurs major difficulties to you.

Through this framework of binomial life narratives, so many personal issues should be interpreted anew.
