I think that the flow of time is a convenient sense-making framework for our minds, which crave to see movement, stories and drama.
I think time, as a variable, is an arbitrary dimension of the geometry of reality and the universe.

So I think the universe is a geometric essence which, by itself, just is: without change, without movement, without time, without meaning, without a story.
Observing reality through our minds and trying to make sense of it, we see patterns, because that is what our mind does.
Patterns are a way to generate structure and order: here we see things moving through space, changing over time, respecting some physical universal laws, living their own - however meaningful - lives.

That is what the mind sees because that is what the mind is looking for, because that's how the mind works.
The scientific method is less prone to the subjective, faulty perception of the mind.
Science suggests the structure of reality is a multi-dimensional geometric logic, of which the mind can only observe and measure and perhaps even understand only parts of, throguh its own sense-making and time-generating logics.

What I suggest is that reality is a fixed, multi-dimensional geometric logic.
This geometric logic would involve what, to us, looks like spirals and linear patterns.
That logic, however coherent, strong or orderly we might see it, presumably does not respect any of our minds' own sense-making attributes of age, movement, distance or order.

We are stuck in 3 dimensions. We can only experience reality at this level.
Only through our imagination can we access more dimensions than 3.
We can access, in this world, new worlds.
We do this through portals: doors we can find in this world, which open up a whole new dimension and give us access to a whole new world. 
We do this in many of our stories: harry potter's platform 9 and 3/4s, alice in wonderland's little door in the garden, acids like LSD, dreams, or just through our own imagination.
In mathemathics, a good example of a portal is the square root of negative 1: it exists within the realm of real numbers, and it brings us to a whole new dimension of imaginary numbers.
Another example might be virtual reality headsets: we can wear them, and suddenly our mind is overwhelmed with new logics of information which are other-worldly.
