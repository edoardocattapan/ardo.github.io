I think that the flow of time is a convenient sense-making framework for our minds, which crave to see movement, stories and drama.
I think time, as a variable, is an arbitrary dimension of the geometry of reality and the universe.

So I think the universe is a geometric essence which, by itself, just is: without change, without movement, without time, without meaning, without a story.
Observing reality through our minds and trying to make sense of it, we see patterns, because that is how our mind operates.
Out of the chaos of information that is reality, patterns for our minds are a way to generate structure and order: here we see things moving through space, changing over time, respecting some physical universal laws and living their own - meaningful? - lives.

That is what the mind sees because that is what the mind is looking for, because that's how the mind works.
The scientific method is less prone to the subjective, faulty perception of the sense-making mind.
Science suggests the structure of reality is a multi-dimensional geometric logic, of which the mind can merely observe and measure, and perhaps even understand, only parts of, throguh its own time-generating ways of sense-making.

What I suggest is that reality is a fixed, multi-dimensional geometric thing.
This geometric thing would involve a design which, to us, would look like spirals and linear patterns.
That logic, however coherent, strong or orderly we might see it, presumably does not respect any of our minds' own sense-making attributes of age, movement, distance or order.

We are stuck in 3 dimensions. We can only experience reality at this level, through our sense-making minds.
We cannot escape the nature of who we are.

Only through our imagination can we access more dimensions than 3.
We can access new worlds.
And the gateways or access points to any new world exist - necessarily - in this world.
These gateways, we might call them portals: doors we can find in this world, which open us up to new dimensions and can give us access to a whole new experience of reality.
In our minds, irrationality if the portal.
We do this in many of our stories: harry potter's platform 9 and 3/4s, alice in wonderland's little door in the garden, acids like LSD, dreams, or just through our own imagination.
In mathemathics, a good example of a portal is the square root of negative 1: it exists within the realm of real numbers, and it brings us to a whole new dimension of imaginary numbers.
Another example might be virtual reality headsets: we can wear them, and suddenly our mind is overwhelmed with new logics of information which are other-worldly.

So to sum up, I think reality is a fixed geometrical structure, and it is our sense-making mind that generates time and movement to see more patterns.
Rationality is about making order out of what our mind originally has to deal with, which is a choatic universe of information.
In this sense, science is the best tool for observation and understanding of the mind-generated order.

But there is another way for us to navigate through reality's multi-dimensional and multi-variable geometrical essence.
Through portals, we can jump to new worlds and see reality from a totally new perspective.
We can imagine - and therefore exist in - new worlds: real worlds.
We can even create such new worlds, as in the example of video-games, movies and novels.

We should not only think rationally, but also feel emotionally, and experiment with new ways of consciously perceiving reality, if what our minds are for is really to make sense of it all.
