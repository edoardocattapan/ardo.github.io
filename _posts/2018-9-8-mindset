Mindset is radically important in life, as well as for understanding social phenomena.

Attitude is a crucial aspect in explaining - and therefore a useful tool for predicting - one's outcomes in life.
Mindset determines a fundamental part of life outcomes.
Not only because it is a determining factor setting up one's attitude in approaching a problem or venture, but because the very activity of mind-setting (priming the mind for an activity) is also at the basis for interpreting the final result and judging whether a certain outcome is successful or not for the invividual.
