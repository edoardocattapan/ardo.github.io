Mindset is radically important in life, as well as for understanding social phenomena.

One could explain in retrospect the results of past major political elections using fundamental psychology paradigms, like optimism-pessimism.
Such psychological tools can be used to infer predictions about future elections or events which are massively driven by either individual or mass psychology.

At the same token, attitude is a crucial aspect in explaining - and therefore a useful tool for predicting - one's outcomes in life.
Mindset determines a fundamental part of life outcomes.
Not only because it is a determining factor setting upone's attitude in approaching a problem or venture, but because the very activity of mind-setting (priming the mind for an activity) is also at the basis for interpreting the final result and judging whether a certain outcome is successful or not for the invividual.
