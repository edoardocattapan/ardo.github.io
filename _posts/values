Honesty, Courage, Kindness.

My worldview reduced to its fundamental foundations, the values one finds are a triad of virtues: honesty, courage and kindness.

Courage could be the why, kindness the how, the truth the what.
Always telling the truth with kind, compassionate, warm regards towards people and things because one bravely fights his fears.
