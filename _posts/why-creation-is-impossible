Creation is the process by which something comes into existence from a place of non-existence.
In the same fashion, annihilation is the process by which something goes out of existence into a place of non-existence.

When we accept creation and annihilation - birth and death - in our conception of the world, we easily come to connect the dots and paint the picture of "*becoming-in-time*".
That is to say: the process by which *something* (something like *you*, the reader) is non-existent, then it is born (coming into existence), lives (exists), and then dies (goes into non-existence).
The process of *becoming-in-time* strictly implies an irreversible flow of time.

Creation, annihilation and the process of "becoming-in-time" are all, then, very tightly interrelated and necessary for each other to legitimize the concept for the flow of time.

**Creation and annihilation are impossible because what exists is a-temporal.**

What exists has no nihilistic tendency of "becoming" nothing, which would concur into legitimizing the flow of time.
What does-not-exist has no tendencies into a supposedly inherent power of creation, which would change nothing into something.

Of that which does not exist, actually, there exist no properties to attach to, nor actions to attribute to.
Talking about what does exist, there is a stark truth to be acknowledged: there is no possibility - and no need - for change.

There is no possibility (or need) for things to *become" something other than which they are.
