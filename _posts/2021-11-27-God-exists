The great human lives have faith in God.

The reason is deep, abstract and simple: the individual will to live is as strong as the faith in a greater power of life to realize it.

The coming of fate conduces to seeing why God exists.
It takes perspective to hope, believe, have faith and know that fate is here.
Fate coming, destiny being unrolled under the present, the self actualizing, reality unfolding, things being consciously alive manifest a deeper, grander truth.
What that truth is is God being here now.
The grander the scheme of ideas, the weaker the words are to grasp it, the more meaningful the idea.
God.
It's here.

In fact, God being here, we are it.
