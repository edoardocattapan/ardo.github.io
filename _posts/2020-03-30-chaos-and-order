where is the line of distinction between chaos and order?
what distinguishes chaos from order is not just having to do with unpredictability, as an organized process 

The complementary creative forces of chaos and order seem to be pervading everything, balancing each other in the characterization of reality.
The birth of a child is seen as a miracle of nature, just as it is interpreted deterministically by means of biological processes.
The birth of a poem is seen as a misterious miracle of the intuitive mind, just as it manifests itself by means of a sequence of words under strict metrical rules.

The sagittarius constellation is a fantastical symbolization of a bunch of stars as seen from the Earth at night.
Among the many questions one could have in front of the sagittarius depicted on the night sky, a deep one has to deal with why the mind can *arbitrarily* connect the dots in the dark canvas of chaos only to see what it wants.

Where are the limits where chaos becomes order?
Do those limits precisely reside in the pattern-seeking and sense-making mind?
Is this distinction totally, or even partially, arbitrary?

To the extent that the future beckons uncertainty, the present beckons certainty.
And the beauty is that future beckons present, that uncertainty beckons certainty, that backward beckons forkward, that darkness beckons light, that night beckons day, that she beckons him, that full beckons empty, that circle beckons line, that bad beckons good, that randomness beckons definiteness, that luck beckons causality, that chance beckons design, that chaos beckons order.

The awe is that the reverses are also true.

The real principle in force is then, by all means, arbitrariness.
