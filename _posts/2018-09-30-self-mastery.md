Self-mastery is about managing one's needs, expectations, thoughts and beliefs with the best perspective.

The best perspective, as in most productive and most enjoyable at the same time, is one of self-love.
Self-love expands the self beyond one's physical boundaries, to embrace one's best and worst characteristics and happenings, the surroundings, the momentary circumstances, the other living things (people, animals, plants and nature) with no spatial limits.

Stoic philosophy is about understanding that the self is very fallacious, and being truly prepared for coping with the worst imaginable scenarios so to face the day with a confidence that is now intrinsic to the self and not dependent to external circumstances.
This understanding brings to deep self-acceptance: compassion for the human finite situation, forgiveness for one's own fallacies, appreciation of one's own good qualities and gratitude for the chance to be even alive and aware in the first place.
This higher level of consciousness is the doorway to self-love.

When you love yourself, you get that you are not your body, and you are not your thoughts.
Your body is just a part of what you now feel you truly are: a physical incarnation which makes you present and relevant in the physical dimension of reality.
But your body is leaving you, it's changing, getting old, and one day it will stop working altogheter.
And you are not your thoughts, as these come from chemical connections in your neural system (the brain) which are tied to facts which are no longer as relevant compared to the reality you get to experience in the present moment with your perceptions.

When you love yourself, you are the bigger person, you have a big-picture perspective on everything, and so you can realize that you truly do not need anything that you don't already are.
When you love yourself, you identify yourself with everything, and every single part of everything: every individual form of life.

Love is the space of reality.
Love, as reality, starts by climbing up the ladder of self-awareness.
This is self-mastery.
