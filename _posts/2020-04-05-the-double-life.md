Life is difficult because you live two lives in the same streak of being alive.

One life is your personal story as an individual: your name, your personality, your interests and ambitions.
This life is about independence, personal control and free will.

The other life is your being a member of humanity, a member of civilazation, a ring inside the chain of human generations, a result of your parents as a possible means to new members of humanity, an anonimous piece for the continuation of the specie.
This life is about total dependece, and (in)voluntary surrender to bigger forces, for nature's necessities.

While the two motives for existence intersect right in your life story-line, the discrepancies are rearkable at the fundamental level.
These story discrepancies, or radical differences in bothe means and ends of being alive, can make life difficult for you.

For example, a genetical drawback being evident in your physicality or even personality, you could repeatedly fail at the game of natural selection played by the opposite sex, even when building a family was one of your life goals, or perhaps you have other hidden ereditable qualities that would otherwise have been a treasured heritage for the continuation of the specie, which will never be passed on.
In this case, your personal life story shows a different goal than your specie's life story through you.
Of course, in a way and to an extent, your personal goals can override your specie's goals as expressed through your life, when you decide to artificially inseminate or otherwise use condoms, for example.
In this case, the discrepancy has no particular malevolency to incur major difficulties to you.

In this framework, so many issues can be interpreted anew.
