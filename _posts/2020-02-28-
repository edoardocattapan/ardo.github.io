There is no way of living which is ultimately perfect for the human condition.
Even accepting all your flaws, mistakes and shortcomings veils a real and miserable sense of guilt for yourself and a deep real disappointment over life.

There is no long-lasting ecstasy, no life-long sense of awe and bewilderment, no pure love that can last longer than a handful of moments.
It is true that we only live in moments, and that it is a choice whether we feel in love and awe or not.
But how much less true is it that we live in days, and in years, and in decades? And how much willful control do we really have within our own conscious experience to excercise ordered choices about how we feel?

Uncertainty is the condition of our experience.

The mind, the spirit and the body are inside chaos. At the edge of the mechanisms of the mind, the spirit and the body for ordering our conscious experience, we live inside chaos.

It is fully facing chaos that the mind is free from what is already known.
It is fully facing chaos that the spirit is alive and burning.
It is fully facing chaos that the body can breathe and move.
