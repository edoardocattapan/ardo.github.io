The structure of reality is a multidimensional geometry where interconnected relationships arise within a stable wholeness and unity.

The animation of a man-made cartoon is the sequentiation of a pile of 2D drawings along a thrid dimension, like when you whatch a small cartoon by quickly flipping the pages of a book or a post-it.
Motion pictures you see at the cinema follow the same logic, where action is the smooth sequentiation of different frames across time.
This logic is compelling and works with as many dimensions as you like.

In fact video-games, virtual reality and the "real world" can be put under the same lenses.
The a-temporality of a video-game or, more generally, the a-spaciality of a virtual-reality environment are indications that it is possible for a-spatial-a-temporal realities to exist.

After all, what is the *reality* we perceive, but a sequentiality of 3D instantiations along a very malleable fourth dimension of duration?
Inside the dimension of duration, time has in theory a very malleable verse and directionality, even though our perception of time seems to be stuck to one irreversible verse along a determined direction, albeit with a very malleable velocity.

Like when you slice bread it is the depth which gives it a 3-dimensional character, and when you see a movie it is the duration of the sequencing of frames which gives the film action, so when you ponder the *real world* it is the transcending of each situation's specific distance and duration into further dimensions which gives reality its stable wholeness and unity.
