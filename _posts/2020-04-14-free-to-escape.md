Free is the man who embraces what is necessary, contemplates the necessity of life and accompanies his own trajectory in the direction of his destiny.

Enslaved is the man who does not contemplate life, who finds home in the dullness of reactivity causing his life trajectory to be walked along without ever looking up or thinking what's outside.

The ever-sharpening edge of the acute intellectual quest is the place of the free.
At this edge answers are not found, only questions.

If you want to be a free man, ask *why?* and ask *what if?*

These two questions are your tools to enact your personal escape: the former enlightens your curiosity for reflection, the latter is your drawing board for creating new portals of escape.
You can think about things, or creatively draw the doors into new places.

I like to think of my intellectual efforts as two instants of freedom: contemplation and imagination.

And my freedom goes along with necessity ruling the world: it lets me see what might be ahead in my path by walking me towards my destiny.
