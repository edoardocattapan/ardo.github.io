**Openness** (96th percentile)
I think in abstract, complex ways. I tend to be imaginative, creative, adventurous and intellectual.
I enjoy playing with ideas and discovering novel experiences. I like the unkown.
I enjoy art and like original and complex forms of self-expression, like video-logs, singing, dancing, painting and sculpture, as well as ranting.
I enjoy novelty, variety, and change. I am curious, imaginative, and creative.
I am intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty.
I tend to be aware of my feelings and tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways, typical of intellectual figures.
I have a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience.
In my case, this symbolic cognition has not taken the form of mathematical, artistic, metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the many visual or performing arts.
But instead has taken the form of logical, spatial/geometric thinking and very abstract ideas.
I have very broad interests in abstract and complex topics, such as philosofy, physics and psychology.
I consider myself mature psychologically.
Imagination: often the real world can be too plain and ordinary, so the use of fantasy is a way of creating a richer, more interesting world.
Artistic interests: I love beauty, both in art and in nature. I become easily involved and absorbed in artistic and natural events, like sunsets or flowers, or green areas with a course of water nearby. I am not necessarily artistically trained nor talented. I appreciate both natural and artificial beauty. I enjoy a high aesthetic sensitivity and interest in the arts.
Emotionality: I tend not to express my emotions openly to most people, as I need a close and strong bond of trust with a very select few individuals to be able to share my emotions unfiltered.
Adventurousness: I am very eager to try new activities, although I am not naturally prone to travel to foreign lands as most people seem to be. I really like to change my work/home commute everyday, as well as change my breakfast and lunch as much as possible, taking new options just because they are different than usual. I am not only comfortable with change, I mostly seek out change to a routine.
Intellect: Intellect and artistic interests are the two most important, central aspects of openness to experience. I love to play with ideas. I am very open-minded to new and unusual ideas and like to debate intellectual issues. I enjoy reading about complex abstract ideas and theories about people, society and nature. I have very high regard for serious intellectual endeavours in disciplines such as philosophy, physics and psychology. I scored high in intelligence tests in the past and I am told I am smart.
Psychological liberalism: I am mostly ready to challenge authority and conventional ways of doing things. On the other hand, I recognize and appreciate the solid and reliable stability and security brought by comforming to the rules of finite games. I appreciate chaos in artistic expression, not in people behaviours and the organization of society. I like chaos in ideas, not in people.

**Conscientiousness** (81st percentile)
I am ver good at exercising self-discipline and self-control in order to pursue my goals.
I am generally very organized (I set my schedule in my calendar even for free time) and determined, and am able to forego immediate gratification for the sake of long-term achievement.
I am not impulsive and can easily say no to alternative options that would point me towards other directions.
I seem to have developed a strong sense of responibility that allows me to easily decline or postpone what feels good in the moment if it is in the way of doing what is less fun but will pay off in the future.
I set long-term goals for myself and work towards them.
I amreasonably reliable, organized and self-controlled.
If intelligence involves impulse control, I am prudent, meaning both wise and cautious, as I think before doing things.
I am perceived by others as intelligent and reliable.
On the negative side, I can sometimes be perceived as "nerdy" and boring, as I can get intense and purposeful in talking about important things (work-related or not), although I am not a workaholic (staying long hours working at the office) nor a perfectionist (as I appreciate time constraints and have a strong bias toward action). 
I easily avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence.

**Extraversion** (58th percentile)
In the introvert-extrovert spectrum, which assesses the extent to which I derive my energy and focus from the inside world or from the outside world, I locate very close to the centre.
To be fair, I have always clearly been introverted, but I have been able to consciously overcome some social anxiety and put myself in social situations more often to become more at ease with people, as I regard it is necessary for living a more meaningful and happy life.
In a group of introverts, I tend to be the most extroverted individual, being more open and seeking attention from others as a way to stimulate my energy.
On the other hand, I don't go the extra mile to actively engage with people to earn friendship or admiration.
Mostly, I feel more energetic after spending time alone, and feel exhausted after spending time at parties or with many people.
I like to conserve my energy by talking less and moving or walking purposefully around people.
When I achieve a goal, I feel a positive emotional payoff of joy, relief and accomplishment, which is often focused on myself and shared with the closest people who helped along the way, rather than publicizing my achievements to get the attention of others.
I tend to have great perspective and long-term view on life even when achieving big goals like getting a promotion, finding a new romance, or winning an award.
Mostly, I tend to be more content with a simple and quiet way of living, where my achievements are for myslef, and rarely seek attention from others.
I score low on extraversion, indicating I am introverted, reserved, and quiet.
I really enjoy solitude and solitary activities. My socialization has a very strong tendency to be restricted to a few close friends, with whom I like to go deep.
Nonetheless, I seem to strongly exhibit a typically extraverted trait, which is a bias toward action.
I am very likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to new opportunities for excitement.
Also, I am assertive: decisive, strong-willed, self-confident, bold and determined.
But mostly, I tend to be quiet, low-key and deliberate.
In fact, as an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension, I do not seek others out but I will be quite pleasant when approached.
Friendliness:  I am not necessarily cold, although I can be perceived as distant and reserved, as I demonstrate close friendship and even intimacy to just a few select people.
Gregariousness: I generally avoid crowds, as I see the risks outweighting the benefits. When I am in a crowd I perceive a decrease in the number of options I could choose for myself (for example, where to go), therefore a lack of freedom and control over the environment.
Assertiveness: I like to speak out and take charge of initiatives, as I usually have a bigger sense of direction and motivation to direct the activities of others. This however does not necessarily happen every time I am in a group setting, as I tend to prefer not talking much, listening and letting others take control of the activities of the group, for me to assess whether I trust and support their leadership or not.
Activity level: I like and tend to exhibit a leisurely, relaxed and deliberate pace in the way I think and act in the world, as opposed to feeling the urge to do many activities in a fast-paced, highly energetic way.
Excitement-seeking: I do not particularly appreciate flashy bright lights or very loud music.
Cheerfulness: I typically experience a range of positive feelings, including happiness, contentment and optimism, and sometimes experience excitement and joy.

**Agreeableness** (54th percentile)
I tend to experience a fair deal of empathy for my peers, although I feel less empathy for people who are worse off than myself in society.
Of course the reason is that I can more easily relate to people living in similar social conditions to mine.
I tend to get pleasure out of serving and taking care of others, as I know that is a well-intended activity and is making a positive difference to people's lives. They are usually trusting and forgiving.
Generally I tend to place my own concerns ahead of other people, and have always been very competitive in finite games, be it sports competitions or recreational playing activities.
However, I know that cooperating is better than competing with others in the context of infinite games - such as business and life - and therefore I always act accordingly.
I can be very pleasant to spend time with, sympathetic and cooperative, as well as a great listener.
I am usually a considerate person, friendly, generous, helpful and willing to compromise my own interests with others'.
I have an optimistic view of human nature, as I believe people are generally basically honest, decent and trustworthy.
I appreciate the value of the saying "better to be happy than to be right" in most basic-level social interactions, and similarly "better to be kind than to be smart" if we care about social relationships more than we care about the truth.
I have high morality principles, so I strive to be as honest, frank, candid and sincere as I can with everybody else. I think putting up a guard in front of the truth is a waste of precious time and energy.
I like helping others because I appreciate the real-world effects of the idea that I am mostly self-sufficient and have many gifts that I should strive to share with other people by giving more than receiving.
