Here is an attempt to formulate a list of questions which respect 3 criteria:
- the true verifiable answer remains yet unknown to humankind
- finding the true answer implies expanding human knowledge in a given area
- the issue is important to humankind

Questions are very important. They originate all progress of knowledge and serve to make sense of information.
We can only ask questions whose presumable existence of its true answer we are at least conscious of, even if we do not know it.
In an age where artificial intelligence is presumably getting more powerful to provide answers faster, cheaper and more accurately than we humans, our scope increasingly relies in asking better questions.

The questions are not categorized and grouped into different disciplines and compartments of human knowledge, and therefore are not presented in any particular order.
